<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>&#8220;YOU&ndash;&ndash;YOU SIMPLETON!&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>A sturdy boy in homespun, a lad of nearly
fourteen years, whose eyes were clear and gray
and whose face was resolute and honest, led
his little sister by the hand, for she was small and the
road was rough.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll rest, &#8217;Omi, when we come to the big tree.
Are you cold?&#8221; he asked, for there was the chill of
March in the wind, though the sun lay very warm in
the sheltered places.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Who?&#8221; she asked, pointing a tiny hand at
two riders turning the corner, a youth of about seventeen
and a young girl. Their horses were spirited and
the black groom following urged his horse.</p>
<p>The youth was not attractive, though his riding
habit was the fashionable product of a London tailor
in the style of 1772. His hair was dark, his eyes
steely blue and set close to a long nose; his mouth
was ill adapted to a pleasant smile.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>The girl was attractive, a fact people were quick to
recognize, and she was so accustomed to seeing them
turn and look after her that she would have been
piqued had they not done so. Her ways were wilful
but there was a grace in them all. Mischief lurked in
the dark blue eyes, which now lighted with genuine
pleasure. She fluttered from her horse as a bird
alights and threw her arms around the child, exclaiming,
&#8220;And how is little Naomi?&#8221; Then, holding
the child from her, she looked in her face and said,
&#8220;You are a dear. Aren&#8217;t you proud of her, Rodney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s just as good as she looks,&#8221; the boy replied,
blushing with pleasure, and then glanced at the youth,
who did not appear to notice him but slyly spurred
his horse, so that the animal in swerving would have
knocked Rodney into the ditch had the lad not been
nimble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nith; red,&#8221; said the child, clutching the girl&#8217;s
scarlet cloak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you like my poor, old red hat, too, don&#8217;t
you? though Cousin Mogridge says it ill becomes
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eth, pretty too,&#8221; and the child pouted her lips for
a kiss.</p>
<p>Not one, but several, were most graciously given
her with the admonition: &#8220;Next time you be sure
and remember me and my name. Say Lisbeth Danesford.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lithbeth Danethford,&#8221; repeated the child, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
up into the face of the girl, her big, brown eyes full
of seriousness. &#8220;I like &#8217;oo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a care, &#8217;Omi, for once Lisbeth knows that
she&#8217;ll treat you as she does her other admirers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This remark was surprisingly impolite for Master
Rodney Allison, but he was offended that Lisbeth
had not introduced him to her London cousin, whom
he was itching to thump. Moreover he had experienced
Lisbeth&#8217;s fickleness.</p>
<p>She ignored him and said: &#8220;&#8217;Omi, where did you
find such eyes? They are like stars with dew on
them,&#8221; but suddenly she broke off and, with a bound,
snatched from her cousin&#8217;s hand the whip with which
he was about to lash Rodney.</p>
<p>The youth, evidently not liking the conversation,
had again spurred his horse against young Allison,
who without ceremony had seized the bit and set the
animal on his haunches, nearly upsetting the rider.</p>
<p>Lisbeth had seen enough to know what had caused
the trouble. &#8220;Boys are bullies,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
a test for your valour. Who&#8217;ll rescue my abused hat
from the dragon?&#8221; saying which she sent it spinning
over the fence.</p>
<p>Now the dragon was nothing less than a full grown
and surly bull grazing in the pasture.</p>
<p>Rodney, enraged at Mogridge&#8217;s insolence and
taunted by her words and the sight of the hat scaling
like a low-flying swallow, yielded to the mad impulse
to follow it. He would show the arrogant London
youth what a Virginia boy dared do!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>The bull had lifted his head in amazement, which
gave place to rage at the red thing flashing before
his sullen eyes. Snorting, he charged just as the lad
snatched the hat from the ground and, turning, ran
toward the fence.</p>
<p>It was a foolhardy deed, and the boy&#8217;s chance of
escape seemed hopeless,&ndash;&ndash;when the unexpected happened.</p>
<p>A little figure climbed the fence and with a shrill
cry ran to meet him, waving her red cloak to distract
the brute&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>The boy started to run between the bull and the
girl, but she shrieked, &#8220;I&#8217;m all right. Run for your
life!&#8221;</p>
<p>Had not the beast hesitated, uncertain which of the
two was his tormenter, this story would be brief
indeed. Before Mogridge had dismounted the two had
reached safety.</p>
<p>The girl, almost breathless, turned to Rodney,
stamped her foot and between her gasps cried:
&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;simpleton!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney Allison, being now in his right mind and a
sensible lad, realized the merited rebuke, though
scarcely from the girl who had dared him to make
the venture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy Squire Danesford will think you one too,
Bess, when he hears of you facing charging bulls like a
Spanish picador, all to save churlish fools from their
folly,&#8221; said her cousin, sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare tell him! If you do I&#8217;ll never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
speak to you again.&#8221; There was a tearful note in the
girl&#8217;s voice and a disagreeable one in the youth&#8217;s
laugh.</p>
<p>Again he laughed and with flaming face she cried,
&#8220;Perhaps you had better tell him all while you&#8217;re
about it; how you sat your horse like a pat of dough
and watched me do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Rodney&#8217;s turn to laugh, which he did most
heartily, and Mogridge, his face redder than his fancy
waistcoat, wheeled his horse and rode after the girl
who was spurring ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to roll him in the mud and you&#8217;d like to
have me do it, wouldn&#8217;t you, &#8217;Omi?&#8221;</p>
<p>Naomi, trudging confidingly by his side, looked inquiringly
out of her big eyes, stars with plenty of dew
on them now, for during the excitement she had lifted
up her voice in wailing and the tears had flowed
freely.</p>
<p>Not until the riders drew rein at &#8220;The Hall&#8221; did
Henry Mogridge overtake his cousin in the headlong
race home. As it was, she dismounted before he
could offer assistance and ran up the steps and across
the white pillared veranda into the great wainscoted
hall. An instant she paused, looking up at the
portrait of a beautiful woman hanging there, and then
went to her room.</p>
<p>The flickering light from the logs in the big fireplace
relieved the shadows on the face in the frame, a
face so like that of the girl&#8217;s as to leave no doubt
whence she had inherited her charms.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>The colour of hair and eyes, the poise of head, all
were strikingly like, but in the girl&#8217;s face was a wilful
recklessness, perhaps due to lack of a mother&#8217;s care,
the mother she had never known, but more than probable
an inheritance from her father, the reckless,
hot-headed, sporting squire.</p>
<p>At table that evening the girl said little and made
an excuse to leave before the last course.</p>
<p>Would her cousin tell her father? At the thought
a look of defiance was in the girl&#8217;s face, a look not
pleasant to see there.</p>
<p>As for the youth with the long nose and the narrow
eyes, he had other plans for the present. Just now he
was making himself as companionable as possible to
his uncle, and it must be admitted he knew somewhat
of the ways in which to do this. He told of the latest
plays and scandals, to all of which the squire listened
with occasional interruptions and allusions to what he
knew of the London of the Fifties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jupiter!&#8221; cried Mogridge, &#8220;but I&#8217;d think you&#8217;d
find the Old Dominion mighty tame after the pleasures
and associations you enjoyed in that good old town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in adapting one&#8217;s self, my boy. I&#8217;m a bit
old and Lisbeth is too young to show you what
pleasures the Old Dominion really can afford. I&#8217;ll
have to turn you over to the Reverend Pothero. He&#8217;s
a rare blade and sure cure for ennui.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hear tales of some of your Virginia parsons,
and the joke of it is the stories, many of them at least,
come from churchmen.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, some things might be better, I suppose,
but what can you expect when so few desire to take
up the work in this country? To tell the truth, it
sometimes was confoundly lonely at The Hall before
Pothero came. But you haven&#8217;t told me anything of
the government&#8217;s latest policy with respect to these
colonies. Will Lord North&#8217;s hand be strong on the
helm and what have we to fear from that arch
demagogue, Pitt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;North&#8217;s hand will be as firm as the king&#8217;s and no
firmer. Pitt will be dead when he has ceased to be a
demagogue. The king speaks of him as &#8216;That
Trumpet of Sedition,&#8217;&#8221; replied Mogridge with an
air of sagacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear you are right. His words have afforded
the would-be traitors in this land their chief encouragement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And from what I hear they seem to be having
their way in Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s the very old Harry to pay here. Men
whose position and interests lie in retaining the old
order of things are catering to the rabble for a little
temporary advantage. You see, the past few years,
the Scotch-Irish immigrants have been pouring into
the northwestern part of the colony. By nature
and education they are hostile to rightful authority,
are Dissenters and opposed to contributing in the
way of taxes for the support of the established
order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that the other side, the men who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
are using these ignorant people for their purposes,
have control of the House of Burgesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fools! to think they can scare England by refusing
to buy goods of her just because she wishes them
to pay a small tax. I&#8217;ve just heard that Colonel
Washington met Richard and Francis Lee at the
Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg the other night after
the governor, God bless him! had dissolved the
Burgesses; that with Tom Jefferson and Patrick
Henry they laid their plans for uniting with the rebels
in the other colonies. I can&#8217;t understand of what such
men as Washington are thinking. Treason, <i>pur et
simple</i>, that&#8217;s what &#8217;twill come to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry is a wonderful orator, they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Words, words, and more words. Where he learns
&#8217;em all is a mystery, for he&#8217;d much rather talk than
study. He&#8217;s infatuated young Jefferson, who&#8217;s
yeoman on his father&#8217;s side, but who&#8217;s as smart as he
is conceited. What do you suppose that young scamp
is trying to accomplish? Nothing less than the ruin
of the old families of this Dominion, sir. He would
so change our laws that, instead of our estates descending
to the eldest son and thus being kept up, they
would be divided among the children, as is done in
Massachusetts. And he would disestablish the
church, he would, by gad, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>The squire&#8217;s face, always florid from high living,
was now so purple with passion that his wily nephew,
fearing apoplexy, changed the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, uncle, why don&#8217;t you send Lisbeth to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
England to finish her education? She&#8217;s growing to
be a handsome woman and surely, if you&#8217;ll pardon me,
your broad acres can yield sufficient to fit her for the
high position she&#8217;ll be called to occupy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s but a girl, all I have. She&#8217;s like her dead
mother and I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t let her go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But think what her mother would wish. Go over
with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave the estate. The slaves are only to be
depended on when they have a capable overseer. Mine
is not altogether trustworthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me but I don&#8217;t think it right for her to
associate with servants and people like the Allisons.
By the way, who are these Allisons? When riding
this afternoon we met the boy and child, and Lisbeth
made much of them. Surely they are not of our
class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allison is a Scotchman. I happened to be at
Norfolk when he landed from the old country. The
captain told me the fellow had been brought on board
unconscious and with a bad wound in his head. I
liked the man&#8217;s face, and asked no questions. He
never spoke of the matter. I paid the cost of his
passage and let him work it out. He&#8217;s a good accountant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An objectionable person, probably an escaped
convict,&#8221; remarked Mogridge with the air of a judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary he seems a most respectable man.
To be sure he&#8217;s a Dissenter, but one has to expect that.
I&#8217;ve always found him trustworthy. He has taught a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
field school for years and the children make good
progress under his instruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t mean that you allow Lisbeth to go to
such a school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; replied the squire as if in excuse,
&#8220;the school is a small one, confined to my neighbours&#8217;
children, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t allow it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she associates with such boys as that Allison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fine lad. His mother was a Tawbee, old
Squire Tawbee&#8217;s daughter. She was a playmate of
mine and lived at Greenwood till it had to be sold,
after the squire&#8217;s death, to pay the debts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t know about the father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said,&#8221; replied the squire, rather testily, &#8220;that
he&#8217;s a decent man except for his revolutionary notions.
He wants to say &#8216;amen&#8217; every time Patrick Henry
opens his mouth. That, I have no patience with.
England has helped us fight our foes. This hullabaloo
about no taxation without representation fills the
ears of the ignorant. Why, fifty years ago the chronic
growlers opposed the establishment of a postal service
because the government, without consulting the
colonies, charged postage on the letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems, however, that you are providing a living
for a man who is a chronic growler and opposed to
you.&#8221; There was the evident suggestion of a sneer
in Mogridge&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I might look at it that way. I
took him up when he hadn&#8217;t a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but I do not see how one might look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
at it in any other way. A fellow who will do as you
say he is doing, is an ingrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squire frowned, but made no reply, and Henry
Mogridge smiled unpleasantly, for he saw that his
words were surely poisoning his uncle&#8217;s thoughts respecting
the Allisons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLES</h3>
</div>
<p>Mogridge&#8217;s sneers went to bed with the
squire and arose with him in the morning.
The thought that a man whom he had befriended
was opposing him rankled deeply. And while
in this irritable condition one of the first persons the
squire met was David Allison, who had come early
to work on the accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Allison,&#8221; was the squire&#8217;s greeting,
spoken gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Squire Danesford,&#8221; replied the
Scotchman. &#8220;I thought I wad coom early an&#8217; ha&#8217; the
work oot o&#8217; the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So as to have time for carrying on your treasonable
mischief, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Squire, but I dinna think I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye think I don&#8217;t know that you go about preaching
the pernicious doctrines of Patrick Henry and
Tom Jefferson, who sports on his seal that sentiment
of the demagogue: &#8216;Resistance to tyrants is obedience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
to God.&#8217; Who&#8217;s the tyrant? Why, our most gracious
sovereign! That sort of talk is nothing short of
treasonable. The purpose of it is revolution. Oh, I
know!&#8221;</p>
<p>Allison looked at the squire in wonderment, which
apparently served to further excite the squire&#8217;s rage,
for he, without waiting for reply, exclaimed: &#8220;There
soon will come a time when the traitors will have to
eat their words. When she was ready, England put
her powerful hand on the Indies, and they became hers.
She reached out into Canada and, taking France by
the coat collar, marched her out. When she feels like
it, she&#8217;ll devote some spare half hour to knocking your
heads together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bent figure of the Scotchman straightened as he
looked full in the face of his employer. &#8220;You misunderstand
me, Squire; I only ask that England shall
treat the colonists as she would treat Englishmen, for
that is what we are. But for us she wad na&#8217; found
the task o&#8217; running France out of Canada an easy one.
I fought for England in that war as surely as I did
for the colonies an&#8217; I dinna intend to make talk that a
self-respecting man should not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds well, but it means treason; and I
for one will not harbour or support traitors,&#8221; was the
angry response.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; replied Allison, with dignity, &#8220;will permit
no man to control my thoughts or call me a traitor to
the country for which I fought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the kindly relations between the two men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
who in their hearts held warm regard, each for the
other, were abruptly ended in mutual ill will. At a
window looking out stood Henry Mogridge, with the
same disagreeable smile his face had worn the previous
evening.</p>
<p>How like a chill fog stealing in and shutting down,
shrouding a place, is trouble in a household!</p>
<p>The squire was uneasy all the morning and then,
calling for his horse, mounted him and rode away.
Elizabeth eluded her cousin, who, left to amuse himself,
heartily wished himself back in London.</p>
<p>At the home of the Allisons the trouble was of a
very serious nature. David&#8217;s intention to keep from
his wife and family what had occurred that morning,
failed. Mrs. Allison knew that something serious had
happened and, in her quiet way, finally learned what
it was. Rodney, too, learned of it and that night went
to his bed feeling that other boys fared better than he.
There was his cousin, Dick Tawbee, with horses and
dogs and servants to care for them, while he&ndash;&ndash;well,
there was no lad he knew who had so much of
trouble.</p>
<p>It might have contributed to Rodney&#8217;s peace of mind
that evening could he have seen the predicament of a
boy, about his own age, who, to escape abuse, had run
from his cabin home and huddled down behind a
stump in the clearing around the cabin. He lived on
the frontier of the colony of Pennsylvania, and, though
a rather uninteresting little fellow, had troubles of his
own and was bearing them without a murmur, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
instead of thinking about them, was considering the
pleasures the day had afforded him.</p>
<p>The Vuysens with whom he lived, because after the
death of his parents he could not find a better home,
had been abusing him for running away in the morning,
leaving his duties because he had wished to see
a beaver colony at work. He had not intended to do
anything wrong, but the temptation had been too
great. That morning the world seemed overflowing
with the alluring promises of spring, and the birds
were singing in the forest. He thought of the beaver
colony he had discovered the winter before when it
was locked in ice. The ice would now be gone. Surely
here was his opportunity.</p>
<p>He had approached very cautiously so as not to
alarm the little animals, and finally found a place
where he had a good view of them at work, cutting
down trees with their chisel-shaped teeth and building
dams with a skill which causes men to wonder.</p>
<p>While trying to get into a comfortable position he
had stepped on a dry twig that snapped under his feet.
A big beaver slapped his broad tail on the water.
Splash! and they disappeared in a twinkling. But
Conrad, that was the boy&#8217;s name, was a patient little
fellow and after a time his patience was rewarded by
seeing the beaver resume their tasks. Some cut down
the trees, cutting them so they fell just where the
beaver wanted them, woodsmen could have done no
better. Some were piling brush among the branches
of the trees while others brought earth to fill in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
network of brush, patting it down with their broad
tails, as masons would use their trowels; others were
rolling a stone into the dam they were building.
Seemingly they had the work as carefully planned as
men could have done.</p>
<p>Conrad was fond of the woods and animals, his
only friends, for the Vuysens looked upon him as a
sort of slave and treated him unkindly. It was rare
pleasure for the lad to watch the beaver colony, and,
now that he had been turned out of the cabin supperless,
he sat down by the stump to think over his pleasure,
rather than his trouble, and soon fell fast asleep.
While Conrad slept, a small band of Indians was approaching
along a spotted trail leading through the
forest.</p>
<p>When awakened, Conrad thought he was dreaming;
but, after rubbing his eyes and collecting his senses, he
realized that the yelling and commotion were being
caused by savages. His instinct prompted him to steal
away, but, when he saw them leading the horse from
the stable shed and one Indian cruelly beat it, he forgot
himself and rushed to interfere. The horse was
the best friend Conrad had known since his mother
died.</p>
<p>A half drunken savage seized the boy by the hair,
but others interfered, and so it happened that, instead
of being killed on the spot, he found himself, together
with the horse, a prisoner and hurried along the trail
in the forest.</p>
<p>Conrad made no complaint but quietly went with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
his captors. He recalled that Vuysen had said there
was peace with the Indians but had added, in the
words of an old chief, &#8220;The rogues on both sides always
make trouble.&#8221; Perhaps, after all, this was but
a thieving expedition and they might adopt him as a
member of the tribe, a thought which strangely enough
brought comfort to the boy&#8217;s heart. He loved the
woods and did not love the Vuysens. The savages
could not know this and so, though he had no thought
of trying to escape, they bound him. Although his
bonds were uncomfortable he slept soundly, while
Rodney, down in Virginia in his comfortable bed,
passed a restless night; all of which helps to prove
that it does not always depend so much on what one
has, as on what one thinks about it.</p>
<p>When Rodney came down to breakfast the next
morning he was resolved to urge his father to make
a pioneer home in the wonderful West he had heard
so many tales about, out where there was plenty of
big game and where there were broad acres to be had
for the taking.</p>
<p>Not until he had nearly finished his breakfast did
he screw up his courage to the point of carrying out
his resolve. Then he said: &#8220;Father, I&#8217;ve heard you
say there is land out on the Ohio River which you can
have because of your service in the last war. Why
don&#8217;t we settle on it? This place has nothing for us
with the squire for an enemy, and not much at best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You little know of the perils, my lad. Surely ye
wouldna&#8217; ha&#8217; the mother an&#8217; little one killed by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
savages? But I&#8217;m minded to say that a venture into
the western part o&#8217; this colony is much to my liking
this morning. From all I can learn a poor man in
those parts is not so hedged aboot as here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither father nor son thought of the generally observed
fact that when a poor man began to seek a
home where land was cheap he usually became a pioneer
with his face turned toward the West, the great
longing for a better home luring him toward the
richer lands said to lie beyond the mountains.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>HOW RODNEY AND ANGUS BECAME FRIENDS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Say, Sim, what&#8217;s the story you&#8217;s goin&#8217; to tell,
the one yer cousin told ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, tell us about it, Sim.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pupils of the cabin school were having recess.
A few weeks before David Allison had moved his
family up to Charlottesville from the &#8220;tide-water
country,&#8221; and had opened this school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ye see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Sim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we see all right, but thar ain&#8217;t much fun
lookin&#8217; at you gittin&#8217; ready to tell a story. You sure
are slower&#8217;n our ol&#8217; nigger, Absalom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give Sim a chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>Angus MacGregor spoke as one with authority and
his stockily built body looked capable of enforcing the
order. Sim proceeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was sayin&#8217;, Bill, that&#8217;s my cousin, he lives
over in the Shenandoah valley two looks and a yell
from the Jumpin&#8217;-off Place, was out fishin&#8217; with another
feller. When they was goin&#8217; home an&#8217; come out
inter the clearin&#8217; roun&#8217; Fin Anderson&#8217;s cabin, they see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
an ol&#8217; Injun, Bowlegs they call him, snoopin&#8217; roun&#8217;.
They hid an&#8217; watched perceedin&#8217;s. When ol&#8217; Bowlegs
found no one was ter home what&#8217;s he do but walk
right in and bring out a jug o&#8217; corn liquor an&#8217; set
right thar an&#8217; fill his gullet. Then the ol&#8217; varmint laid
down fer a snooze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oughter tarred an&#8217; feathered the ol&#8217; cuss,&#8221; said
Angus.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jes&#8217; what Bill thought, but they didn&#8217;t have
no tar, let alone feathers. But Fin Anderson&#8217;s a curis
feller, an&#8217; Bill remembered that when he went out inter
that country he toted along a feather bed; &#8217;lowed he
wanted somethin&#8217; different to sleep on ter home than
he had in ther woods. When Bill thought o&#8217; that
feather bed he jes&#8217; sithed fer tar, when he&#8217;d make a
turkey gobbler outer Bowlegs. Well, while they&#8217;s
rummagin&#8217; roun&#8217; ther cabin they found some wild
honey Fin had brought in, so they took that an&#8217; daubed
ther ol&#8217; feller from head ter heel and then rolled him
in the feathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kinder rough on Fin&#8217;s feather bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;d sure enough lay it to the Injun. After
they got back home an&#8217; told the story some o&#8217; the
fellers &#8217;lowed as how they&#8217;d go over an&#8217; give Bowlegs
a lickin&#8217; ter boot. Well, when they got in sight o&#8217; the
ol&#8217; rascal, he was jes&#8217; soberin&#8217; up, sittin&#8217; thar rubbin&#8217;
his eyes. &#8217;Bout that time he seen ther feathers stickin&#8217;
out all over him an&#8217; he let out a whoop an&#8217; went tearin&#8217;
off through the brush, sheddin&#8217; feathers at every jump
like an ol&#8217; settin&#8217; hen scared off&#8217;n her nest.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They oughter licked the ol&#8217; redskin; they&#8217;re all
thieves,&#8221; said Angus with an important air.</p>
<p>&#8220;He stole the liquor but it looks like some one else
stole the honey and feathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>All eyes turned toward the speaker who had joined
the group unobserved. He was Rodney Allison.</p>
<p>The face of Angus turned red as a beet. Here was
this upstart new boy with an air of questioning his
authority. By means of Angus&#8217; ability to give any
boy in the neighbourhood a sound drubbing if necessary
he had become the recognized leader. Evidently
this new boy needed to be shown his proper place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Bill an&#8217; his friends ain&#8217;t thieves, I can tell.
An Injun is a born thief, so are most niggers, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve
been told that, when England used to send her thieves
to Virginny, some of &#8217;em turned schoolmasters after
they landed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sammy Dawson snickered and it was Rodney&#8217;s turn
to get red in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know one schoolmaster,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who is an
honest man and always was, though thieving must be
more fun than trying to teach some o&#8217; the lunkheads
who go to his school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sammy didn&#8217;t snicker this time, but his eyes grew
big and round.</p>
<p>Angus began to swell with anger. He stepped
forward and shook his fist under Rodney&#8217;s nose. Then
he found his speech. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known o&#8217; folks,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;who weren&#8217;t wanted down in the tide-water country,
comin&#8217; up this way an&#8217; bein&#8217; sent back with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
hides tanned;&#8221; saying this, he tried to slap Rodney&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>In all the house of MacGregor probably there never
had been a more surprised member than was Angus
five minutes later, for David Allison had taught his
son other things than were found in books; but he
also had taught that this knowledge was not to be used
except rarely, and when absolutely necessary. Rodney
uneasily recalled this part of the instruction after the
fight was over, and he had time to reflect on his part
in bringing it on. Evidently he wasn&#8217;t doing anything
to make the family popular with their new neighbours,
whereas, if he&#8217;d kept his mouth shut instead of interrupting
the conversation, all would have been well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angus, let&#8217;s shake hands. I didn&#8217;t mean any offence
and said more than I ought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angus took the proffered hand rather reluctantly,
and on his face was a look of suspicion, visible along
with a black eye and a bleeding nose. Then he said:
&#8220;You don&#8217;t come to school; got larnin&#8217; enough, I
reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to work days, but study what I can nights,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw ye workin&#8217; with the nigger this mornin&#8217;. I
&#8217;lowed as how down in the tide-water country an&#8217; in
most other places folks as &#8217;sociate with niggers ain&#8217;t
much thought on. A slave has ter be kept in his
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The work has to be done and there are only
Thello and I to do it. He is not a slave, nor is his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
wife. Mother granted &#8217;em freedom after grandfather
gave them to her. Father doesn&#8217;t believe in slavery.
But they would die before they&#8217;d leave us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon they&#8217;re niggers jes&#8217; the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I would trust &#8217;em farther than I would
most white folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got no use fer mixin&#8217; with niggers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Angus, I thought you and I shook
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t like ter refuse to meet ye half way,&#8221;
replied the boy, sullenly, adding &#8220;My father says he
allus &#8217;spicions roosters as don&#8217;t crow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low as how &#8217;twould be like most fellers, as had
licked another, to brag about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Angus suspected the proffered friendship!
&#8220;Well, you see, when I came to think it over, I saw
that I was partly to blame,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;I broke
into the talk and invited trouble. I don&#8217;t like to hear
any one blamed because their skins happen to be black
or red, but it wasn&#8217;t exactly my business, as the talk
wasn&#8217;t addressed to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; said Angus, holding
out his hand, this time with a heartiness which was
unmistakable. Then he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come
up inter this neck o&#8217; woods, but I&#8217;m sorry ye bought
that place o&#8217; Denham, unless ye paid cash down an&#8217;
mighty little at that. The land&#8217;s worn out and the ol&#8217;
skin-flint has stuck two or three others in the same
way. Had a mortgage on it, an&#8217; then foreclosed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what arrangements father made,&#8221;
replied Rodney, uneasy in mind because of what MacGregor
had told him. He knew his father was not
considered a good business man, but always believed
the other man as honest as himself. &#8220;Anyhow I&#8217;m
much obliged to you, Angus, for the warning. Come
over and see me, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank ye, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; was the reply, and the
boys parted friends.</p>
<p>While working in the field that afternoon, Rodney
was so absorbed in assisting and giving Thello directions
about the work they were doing, that he did not
notice the approach of a tall man on horseback until
a pleasant voice greeted him: &#8220;Is this David Allison&#8217;s
son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Rodney replied, recognizing Mr. Jefferson
of Monticello.</p>
<p>&#8220;I overheard some of your directions about the
work, and concluded you have a good understanding
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy flushed with pleasure. &#8220;Thank you, sir.
Thello thinks I&#8217;ve a lot to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed no, Marse Rodney. Yo&#8217; certain sho&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Modesty is a good quality, my boy. I had a long
talk with your father the other day. He is anxious
for you to have all possible advantages. Now I have
books in my library which I&#8217;m sure would afford you
both interest and profit. If you will come to Monticello
soon we&#8217;ll select some,&#8221; saying which he rode
away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, Marse Rodney, but dey&#8217;ll sho&#8217; think
yo&#8217;s not one ob de quality ef yo&#8217; talks dat ar way &#8217;bout
what ol&#8217; Thello thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney made no reply. He stood looking after the
man on horseback who had spoken so kindly and who
had such pleasant eyes, clear hazel in colour, and
which so invited one&#8217;s confidence.</p>
<p>David Allison was an enthusiastic admirer of
Thomas Jefferson, and, on coming to Charlottesville,
had at his first opportunity called on him with a letter
of introduction. At times he would speak so enthusiastically
that Rodney would notice a smile on his
mother&#8217;s face as she said: &#8220;You should remember,
David, that you often have too much confidence in
men. There are those who say that he is striving to
be popular and to win success, and, to please the rabble,
would destroy laws and customs under which the
Old Dominion has flourished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, lass, that&#8217;s true o&#8217; the part but not of all.
Look ye at the lack o&#8217; schools. Teaching is honourable
work in the old country and in New England.
What is it here, an&#8217; what chance have the childer to
ither teaching than I&#8217;m able to gie them? Thomas
Jefferson is an inspiring leader under God&#8217;s direction
I do believe. He&#8217;s surely a fine man to meet an&#8217; seems
disposed to help our Rodney.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>RODNEY&#8217;S VISIT TO MONTICELLO</h3>
</div>
<p>One day there came to David Allison&#8217;s house
a stalwart young man clad in the typical garb
of the hunter, fringed deerskin hunting shirt
belted at the waist, and breeches and moccasins of the
same material.</p>
<p>This was no less a person than George Rogers Clark,
who was to bear such a conspicuous part in the Revolution,
as a daring leader of the forces which saved
the great territory north of the Ohio River to the
United States. His little brother, then but two years
old, was, thirty-six years later, with Captain Lewis,
to conduct the Lewis and Clark expedition from the
Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean and thus enable
our government to secure the territory of the great
Northwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n George,&#8221; as he was familiarly called, was
now planning to establish a settlement near the Ohio
River, and had called to interest David Allison in the
project.</p>
<p>Rodney listened with open-eyed attention to Clark&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
glowing accounts of fertile lands apparently only
waiting for a little enterprise to be developed into a
perfect paradise.</p>
<p>The boy saw that his father was much interested,
but hesitated, saying that circumstances were such that
he must remain where he was for a few years. Rodney
thought he knew the reason but said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may yet see your way clear, Mr. Allison,&#8221;
said Clark on leaving. &#8220;I expect to pass this
way again in a few days, and will call to see if you
haven&#8217;t changed your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the caller was gone Rodney said: &#8220;Father,
I&#8217;ll go to Monticello, to-morrow if I may. You know
Mr. Jefferson invited me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to have you, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The morning gave promise of a beautiful day. By
the time Rodney came to the hill, up which the road
led to Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s residence, the sun shone hotly
and the dust lay thick, but the boy&#8217;s thoughts were on
the visit, and his heart beat quickly.</p>
<p>The country round about is hilly, but &#8220;Little Mountain,&#8221;
as the hill was called before Jefferson gave it
the Italian name, Monticello, was queen of them all,
though Carter&#8217;s Mountain, a short distance west, is
somewhat larger.</p>
<p>Rodney always remembered that morning in May,
when Nat &#8220;single-footed&#8221; the hill without stopping.
No knight ever stormed a castle, no pilgrim ever approached
a shrine with greater earnestness. So eager
was he that he did not fully appreciate the glorious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
beauties of the landscape. The Rivanna River looked
like a ribbon of silvery satin laid on green velvet, all
in striking contrast with the red soil of the tilled fields.
The Blue Ridge mountains, nearly fifty miles distant,
were, in the clear air, a massive and misty blue background
for the picturesque Ragged Mountains near at
hand.</p>
<p>There was little about such small portion of the
house as was then built to indicate to the boy what its
future charms would be. Later, when Mr. Jefferson
talked with him, and explained the plans he had made,
Rodney understood and admired what, after thirty
years in building, thousands have since admired, the
beautiful &#8220;Monticello.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson was found in his garden, working
among his early vegetables. His face was red from
sunburn and he was dressed in a blue coat, gray waistcoat
and green knee breeches. He recognized the lad
at once, and greeted him pleasantly. He had been
measuring the growth of various plants, during stated
periods, and with different fertilizers, and was recording
these facts in his neat handwriting, such as four
years later was to appear on the famous Declaration
of Independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine colt you have there,&#8221; he exclaimed
with enthusiasm, as he noted the horse Rodney had
ridden, and which was being held by a small black
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat is a fine animal, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And well groomed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I care for him myself. He belongs to me, for
father gave him to me when he was a little fellow. He
has learned several tricks. Nat, do you want to go
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nat pawed the ground twice and whinnied vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his way of saying yes, isn&#8217;t it, Nat, boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>The colt&#8217;s answer was to thrust his velvety muzzle
caressingly against the lad&#8217;s cheek, blinking his large
purplish eyes the while.</p>
<p>He was truly a fine animal with breeding in every
line, dark bay in colour, with a black stripe running
from mane to tail.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity, Rodney said: &#8220;Mr. Jefferson,
may I ask your advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly you may.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m afraid father made a mistake when he
bought our place of old&ndash;&ndash;er Mr. Denham. I&#8217;ve been
told two other men bought it and made a failure, having
a mortgage on it. I don&#8217;t know whether father
gave Denham a mortgage, but I do know that, while
he wants to go out on the Ohio and take up his soldier&#8217;s
claim to land, he doesn&#8217;t think it wise to leave
home, I suppose on account of debts. I feel sure he
ought to go. I want to go with him, but if I can do
more by staying at home I ought to. Don&#8217;t you think
he should go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the boy seeking a loan?&#8221; thought Jefferson,
but he said: &#8220;I would not like to advise. Your father
doubtless knows better than we what is best. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
is great eagerness on the part of many people to seek
new homes in the great West, but many who go over
the mountains will return poorer than they went, and
many others will never return at all. That part of
the country has a glorious future, and there&#8217;s much
excitement over the prospects. The pioneer spirit is
resistless, but, were I your father, I should not wish
to take my family. The Indians are troublesome and
growing more restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be willing to stay at home if I could earn
some money to help along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be at your studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so. I&#8217;ve had a pretty good training in
the three Rs and am half way through C&aelig;sar. I can
study a little in the evenings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy noticed that the look the man gave him was
one of warm good will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you certainly haven&#8217;t been idle. Don&#8217;t
give up. Labour and learn, that must every boy or
man do to succeed, and if he learns thoroughly he&#8217;ll
see that good character is also essential to the success
which endures. I rise at daylight, winter and summer.
Yes, my boy, there is something I can get for you to
do, though the recompense will not be large. I&#8217;m having
some land surveyed and you could serve as an assistant
and acquire some practical knowledge besides;
that is, if your father will permit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be proud to have
me in your service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll now go to the library and see what we can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
find, for I&#8217;m of the opinion that what the Reverend
Mr. Stith said about King James won&#8217;t apply to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In his History of Virginia he writes that
King James&#8217; instructor had given him &#8216;Greek and
Latin in great waste and profusion, but it was not
in his power to give him good sense.&#8217; By that
don&#8217;t think that Greek and Latin are not both excellent.
I would advise every boy to study them if
possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were walking toward the house when they met
Mrs. Jefferson. Rodney was introduced, and was received
most graciously. He flushed with pleasure, and
thought how gratified his father would be at the kind
manner with which he was received.</p>
<p>&#8220;What book would you especially like, Rodney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have &#8216;Josephus?&#8217; I began that down at
the old home but father loaned it, and the borrower
never brought it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which assures me I&#8217;m perfectly safe in loaning
to you. Yes, here&#8217;s &#8216;Josephus.&#8217; It&#8217;s well to know history,
especially these days when very important history
is in the making.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Rodney mounted his horse, Mr. Jefferson
stood stroking the animal&#8217;s nose, for he ever admired
a fine horse, and he said: &#8220;If worse comes to worst
this colt would help pay off the mortgage, and, should
you decide to sell him, I would like to have a chance
to buy him;&#8221; then, seeing that the lad&#8217;s face had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
very serious, he quickly added: &#8220;but there won&#8217;t
be any need of that yet awhile. By the way, why did
you give him the name, &#8216;Nat?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I named him after Nathaniel Bacon. Father says
he&#8217;d rather have had Bacon&#8217;s fate and reputation than
Lord Berkeley&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Berkeley didn&#8217;t believe in encouraging boys in
Virginia to read books, so he and I wouldn&#8217;t have
agreed,&#8221; and as the boy rode away he said to himself,
&#8220;and the Berkeleys in this generation think the good
English blood of these colonies can be ruled like
serfs!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Rodney, the brightness somehow seemed to
have departed from the bright day which had held
such promise. His mind had been full of the importance
and pleasure of his visit. Now, he could only
think, &#8220;Must I sell Nat?&#8221; It had never occurred to
him until suggested by Mr. Jefferson. Was it his duty
to part with the colt? Well, if necessary he would
do it, &#8220;But first I&#8217;ll work my fingers off, Nat,&#8221; and he
patted the glossy, arching neck while Nat champed
impatiently at the bit.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the cabin, the boy had
recovered much of his cheerfulness, and entertained
his father with a glowing account of his visit.</p>
<p>David Allison was busily engaged in cleaning the
old rifle he had carried through the French and Indian
war. It was apparent that he had not put away altogether
his desire to join Clark&#8217;s company.</p>
<p>When Rodney told of Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s offer to give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
him work, his father, turning to his wife, said, &#8220;Harriet,
I think I should go.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some minutes nothing was said. Rodney noted
the shadow on his mother&#8217;s face. Finally she replied,
&#8220;It does seem that the hand of Providence is shaping
matters,&#8221; and both father and son knew that the struggle
was past; she would spare no effort to assist in
her husband&#8217;s departure.</p>
<p>The thought of what the wives and mothers
endured, in the work of winning this mighty land,
ought to bring the blush of shame to the face of
every son of woman who does aught to sully its fair
fame!</p>
<p>One week later David Allison left for the land &#8220;over
the mountains,&#8221; and disappeared into the great forest,
which swallowed him as a huge cave the one who explores
it. Both wife and son noticed that he did not
seem bent and old as he had of late. He was the
brave soldier going forth to battle again.</p>
<p>Before he left he arranged, if all went well and
another party the following year should leave for
the West to join them, that Rodney might go with
them.</p>
<p>The next day the boy began his work at Monticello,
but saw little of his employer, who was a very busy
man. Though but twenty-nine years old, Jefferson
was a leader in the colonial legislature, the House of
Burgesses. He had been first among those who
pledged themselves not to buy imports from England,
he favoured better schools, and was known to admire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the methods of government in New England, especially
the town meetings.</p>
<p>These were not held in Virginia. There, the control
of parish affairs was kept in the hands of a few leading
families, and the large estates were handed down to
the eldest son, and so kept entire; whereas, in New
England property was divided among the children.
This, Jefferson was trying to have changed, and consequently
incurred the ill will of those who preferred the
existing methods and laws.</p>
<p>The summer passed quickly with Rodney. The
crops were scanty and his earnings meagre but enough
to warrant his hope that it would be possible for him
to join his father the following spring.</p>
<p>Angus was a frequent visitor at the Allison home.
He was generous, impulsive and rough, and had not
many home advantages, but his friendship for Rodney
never wavered. Like all the boys, he disliked Denham,
who was a fat little man with a greasy smile and
eyes like a pig&#8217;s. He was said to be a miser, and a
cheat, and a coward, which, in the eyes of the boys,
was an unforgivable weakness.</p>
<p>One night Rodney and Angus had been over to a
quilting party at the Dawsons&#8217;, or rather to the frolic
which followed the quilting. There had been dancing
to such music as the squeaky fiddle of Ander Byram
could afford, also refreshments, in which a big ham
and a roast of venison were two prominent features.
The boys left early, Rodney because he had to rise by
five o&#8217;clock the next morning, and Angus because he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
had quarrelled with Betty Saunders. They came out
into the crisp December air singing, &#8220;Polly put the
kettle on, we&#8217;ll all take tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney, being in a confidential mood, told his companion
of his plans for joining his father in the spring,
and then said: &#8220;Angus, I should feel a lot better about
leaving mother if I knew there was some one like you
to help her out of any trouble that might come up.
She might be sick, you know, and old Denham might
try to cheat her in some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shake hands on that, Rod. Don&#8217;t you worry.
Jimminy Jewsharp! but I wish I was goin&#8217; too.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A PLUNGE INTO THE FOREST</h3>
</div>
<p>March fifteenth, 1773, Rodney Allison set out
with a party of five men who were leaving to
join Clark&#8217;s party on the Ohio.</p>
<p>The task would be somewhat like finding the needle
in the haystack, perhaps, but all were confident and
went away in high spirits.</p>
<p>Mrs. Allison smiled bravely and Naomi called after
him, &#8220;You bring back a little bear for me to play
with,&#8221; whereat they all laughed, but the laughter was
very near tears. Indeed Mam threw her apron over
her head and fled to the cook-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want ter look so blue, Rod,&#8221; cried
Angus, coming into the yard. &#8220;I only wish I was
goin&#8217; along. Alec Stephens&#8217; father says thar&#8217;s prairies
out thar where buffalo hev wallered great traces
through the grass, thet&#8217;s higher&#8217;n yer head, an&#8217; the
deer an&#8217; elk are thicker&#8217;n skeeters in the swamp. He
&#8217;lows as how them as gits the land will sure beat the
tide-water gentry on ther home stretch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged the boy turned his face westward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
There were two pack horses in the party and they were
heavily laden. The journey to the river was without
special incident. Many were going over the trail, and
scarcely a day passed that they did not fall in with
others. On arrival at the river the horses were left
and the goods were loaded into canoes.</p>
<p>It was April and the great stream was filled to its
banks. At the start Rodney felt as though he were
paddling their frail craft out to sea toward an unknown
shore. There was something sullen and irresistible
in the might of that dark, swollen river, and
the craft was swept along like a twig on the great
waters.</p>
<p>The red buds were showing on the trees, a sign of
hope, thought the boy. On his calling attention to them
one of the men remarked: &#8220;They ain&#8217;t the only red
thing that&#8217;s out. We want to be on the lookout, fer
the word from the posts is thet the redskins are gittin&#8217;
sassy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third day Dominick Ferguson was Rodney&#8217;s
partner in the canoe. He was a vigilant and powerful
man, speaking a rich brogue, and when he laughed all
who heard him laughed with him. He had lived in
this country for twenty years, coming here as a soldier,
and had passed much of that time on the frontier. It
appeared that he was a man of some education as well
as valuable experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m of the opeenion,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;that there&#8217;ll
be doin&#8217;s out i&#8217; this country ere long. Virginny&#8217;ll not
yield her claims to the country wi&#8217;out speerin&#8217; the why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
an&#8217; Pennsylvania Dutchmen will cling to what they
ha&#8217; like dogs to a root. I&#8217;ve noticed aboot half the
parties we&#8217;ve met are from that colony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think there will be fighting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will there be fightin&#8217; at Donnybrook fair, do ye
ask? Sure there will be fightin&#8217;, an&#8217; while the two
white clans are tryin&#8217; to eat each the ither, the red devils
will be lookin&#8217; for a mouthful, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk as though &#8217;twould have been better for
us never to have left Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure but &#8217;twould ha&#8217; been, but nothin&#8217; venture
nothin&#8217; have is a sayin&#8217; as true now as iver. You
don&#8217;t want to turn back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely do not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Scotch in ye; an&#8217; &#8217;twould ha&#8217; been the
like if &#8217;twere Irish. Now I ha&#8217; the advantage o&#8217; gittin&#8217;
it both sides. Me mother&#8217;s eyes were as blue as any
colleen&#8217;s in all Leinster, while the father o&#8217; me was
from Argyll, which is sayin&#8217; muckle. The one was
papist an&#8217; the father a Presbyterian. When they tell
ye oil an&#8217; water&#8217;ll not mix, look at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard they don&#8217;t ask a man about his religion
out in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, lad, but a mon ha&#8217; need o&#8217; all his religion,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as for me, mother is of the established
church an&#8217; father is a Dissenter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either&#8217;ll do an&#8217; the both ought. It&#8217;ll be no fault
of our forebears if we ha&#8217; not religion in plenty, an&#8217;
some o&#8217; the gude as should gang wi&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>Rodney thought of the morning prayers at home,
his father kneeling by the old splint-bottomed chair.
Tears came to his eyes, he knew not why, for was he
not soon to see his father and were they not to prosper
and go back in the fall for his mother and sister? Yet
he looked out on the swirling water as through a
mist.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the men said you had seen long service
as a soldier in the king&#8217;s army, Mr. Ferguson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I came to this country, an&#8217; when I laid
by me red coat I thought this a bonny place to bide in.
I got me a good team an&#8217; was makin&#8217; a tidy bit cartin&#8217;
supplies ower the mountains when the war broke oot.
I drove me team with Braddock&#8217;s army an&#8217; afterward
joined the militia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father was a soldier under Braddock. I&#8217;ve heard
him tell how brave some of the teamsters were in the
midst of the panic and how cowardly were some of the
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same old story; all kinds o&#8217; folks to make a
world. I mind well the grit o&#8217; one o&#8217; them, Daniel
Morgan was his name. We drove our teams ower
Braddock&#8217;s grave in the road so&#8217;s to hide it from the
redskins. Morgan&#8217;s a mon as belongs at the head o&#8217;
the column. He fears naught on the face o&#8217; the earth,
an&#8217; such men lead oot in this country where courage
an&#8217; skill at war are more account than any ither place i&#8217;
all the world. Morgan an&#8217; I were teaming supplies to
Fort Chiswell i&#8217; the summer of 1756. One o&#8217; the
British officers got mad at him an&#8217; struck him wi&#8217; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
flat o&#8217; his sword when Morgan he oop-ended the officer&#8217;s
person wi&#8217; a smart crack o&#8217; his feest. That
was fat i&#8217; the fire you may be sure. Insubordination
don&#8217;t go i&#8217; the army an&#8217; they tied Morgan to his cart
wheel an&#8217; laid five hundred lashes on his bare back.
&#8217;Twas a wicked sight, the flesh o&#8217; him hung i&#8217; strips,
an&#8217; he as cool as a cowcumber an&#8217; countin&#8217; every stroke.
He always declared they missed a stroke. A braw lad
be that same Dan Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have thought it would have killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keel him! Lad, ye don&#8217;t know the stuff o&#8217; which
such men are made. Why, after he&#8217;d gone into the
service he was ambushed by the savages an&#8217; was shot
i&#8217; the neck, the bullet comin&#8217; oot the mouth an&#8217; takin&#8217;
the teeth o&#8217; one side along wi&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He settled doon i&#8217; Winchester, which was then
weel nigh the jumpin&#8217; off place, licked every mon in
town as wanted a fight, an&#8217; then married a fine woman
an&#8217; bided there as respectable as ye please. I sure
thought, tho&#8217;, he would go to the dogs. I&#8217;m o&#8217; the
opeenion that wife will be the makin&#8217; o&#8217; him. What
the boats ahead doin&#8217;, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are landing at the mouth of the little creek,
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it; &#8217;tis nigh sundown an&#8217; I reckon
they hope to shoot something fer supper,&#8221; saying
which he began to sing in a rollicking voice the following,
which may be presumed to be of his own composition:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the rest o&#8217; the family, Ferguson, come
ashore an&#8217; help with the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help wi&#8217; the work, is it, Joseph, me boy? Joseph
wore a coat o&#8217; many colours, ye know, but he was the
same old Joe all the time. You&#8217;ll niver improve, I&#8217;m
thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney was left to build a fire and told to keep his
eye &#8220;peeled,&#8221; for a prowling savage might happen
along any minute.</p>
<p>When he had a good blaze started, he sat down to
wait. After a few minutes, hearing nothing, he decided
to take his rifle and go up the creek a short distance
in the hope of seeing game.</p>
<p>That those returning and finding him gone need not
be alarmed, he cut a piece of bark from a young tree
and with the point of his knife wrote on the inside:
&#8220;Up creek, back soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy had not gone far when he came upon a
path made by animals passing to and from the creek.
He noticed no fresh tracks but concluded this as good
a place as any where one might lie in wait for a sight
of game.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>He selected the trunk of a fallen tree which commanded
a view of the path and where he would be
screened from the observation of any animal passing.</p>
<p>It was near sunset and the rosy light shone through
thin places in the foliage overhead. Not a sound could
be heard save the murmur of the water in the creek.
Rodney had paddled all day and was tired. He began
to feel drowsy. That would not do and he shook his
head vigorously, resolving to keep awake. He was
fond of hunting and thought it would be very gratifying
if he might return to the fire with something to
show for his efforts.</p>
<p>Back in the woods a fine buck came walking along
the narrow path. When fully six rods from the creek
he suddenly stopped, and lifting his delicate muzzle
snuffed the air inquiringly. The next instant his tail
was lifted, showing the white of the under side, the
&#8220;white flag,&#8221; as the hunters term it, and with a bound
he was off in the forest.</p>
<p>A few minutes later a dark form cautiously came
along, careful not to break a twig beneath his moccasined
feet. He was naked except for a breech-clout.
The tuft of feathers fastened to his &#8220;top-knot&#8221; and
the paint on his face indicated that he was on the warpath.</p>
<p>Turning, the Indian followed the narrow trail in
the direction of the creek for a short distance and then,
leaving the path, made a detour on the side where
Rodney had taken his station.</p>
<p>The boy slept! The sun had gone down and only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
twilight remained. He dreamed that a huge bear appeared
on the path, its shambling feet softly treading.
He tried to raise his rifle but his arms were powerless,
seemed paralyzed! The bear came on, now faster.
Stopping before him it rose on its hind legs and
hugged him with its fore paws, and he struggled to
scream but could not utter a sound. He opened his
eyes. A brawny hand was over his mouth, a powerful
arm about his arms pinioned them to his side. The
hand was red, and on the wrist was a copper bracelet!</p>
<p>A guttural voice spoke low but harshly in his ear:
&#8220;Um no speak. Die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the boy felt his arms being bound with leather
thongs and he looked into the face of the savage, saw
the hideous paint on it, the bright, beady eyes, the
whites of which looked yellow; noted the high cheekbones,
the nose like an eagle&#8217;s beak, the cruel mouth
like a thin slit in the face, and fear was upon him, such,
as he never had known.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely that was Ferguson&#8217;s voice, and must be calling
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloo!&#8221;</p>
<p>The last call was from the other side and it was not
Ferguson&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>The Indian lifted his tomahawk and the lad expected
it to be buried in his head. Instead came the low-spoken
word: &#8220;March!&#8221;</p>
<p>Guided by the savage from behind and stepping
cautiously, as he believed should he break a twig or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
make other noise he would be struck down on the instant,
Rodney went on into the forest.</p>
<p>They had thus advanced less than twenty rods when,
through the trees and standing back to them, they saw
a man. He appeared unconscious of their presence.
Yes, that must be Ferguson! The thought flashed
through the boy&#8217;s mind and, unconscious of his own
safety, his lips opened to cry the alarm, which would
have sounded his own death knell, when he saw a
tomahawk hurtle through the air and bury itself in the
man&#8217;s brain. He fell to his knees without a moan.
The Indian, leaping to his side, had scalped him before
Rodney realized what had happened. Then, seizing
the lad by the shoulder, he ordered him to &#8220;Run.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they stopped the boy was breathless, but the
savage was as cool and snakelike in his movements as
at the first. Soon they were joined by other Indians.
The boy was bound to a tree and they left him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone to ambush our party,&#8221; thought the
boy. What would become of him should the savages
be driven off and he left tied to a tree in that wilderness?</p>
<p>A squirrel running behind him startled him so the
perspiration stood in beads on his forehead. He tried
to comfort himself with the reflection that it would be
better to starve to death tied to a tree than to be burned
to death tied to a stake.</p>
<p>He tugged at his bonds until the blood started on
his wrists. A rattling fire of musketry was heard in
the direction of the river. After a lull there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
more shots followed by yells, which indicated that the
savages had been successful in driving off the whites.</p>
<p>All was still for many minutes. Then he felt,
rather than saw, that he was not alone. A heavy hand
was laid on his wrists, untying the thongs, and his
captor&#8217;s voice again ordered him to &#8220;March.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moon had risen and its light filtered through
the tree-tops. Stumbling forward, and guided as before,
he went on till they came up with the main party
of Indians.</p>
<p>He looked to see if there were other scalps, shuddering
as he did so; but, save that one at the belt of
his captor, he saw none which had been freshly taken.
He therefore concluded the others of his party had
escaped in the boats, leaving him to his fate. There
were other scalps, but they were not from white people.
Evidently the Indians had been South and had
battled with their hereditary enemies, the Cherokees.</p>
<p>For several miles the Indians continued their march.
Rodney was faint from hunger and thirst when
finally they camped for the night. Dried venison was
eaten, the boy receiving his share with the others, also
an opportunity to drink his fill at a cool spring. He
then was stretched upon the ground and each wrist
and ankle was tied to a separate sapling. The red
men prepared for sleep and no one was assigned to
guard. Little sleep came to him. Thoughts of home,
of his father in the great wilderness, flitted through
his mind all night and he rose unrefreshed and sore
in every muscle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>The next day they continued their journey, from
sunrise to sunset, stopping at noon for a hasty lunch.
The second night he was treated as on the first, but
slept soundly because of sheer exhaustion. The following
day the party killed a deer. The Indians, as
was their custom, gorged themselves on the meat, eating
it half raw. They cut up some of the best of it
to carry along with them.</p>
<p>That night, their heavy eating made the savages
sleep soundly. Rodney, bound as on the previous
nights, lay looking up through the trees at the moon,
occasional glimpses of which it was possible to get
through the branches.</p>
<p>For a time his thoughts were far away from his
surroundings. Suddenly he became conscious of
something cold and metallic under his right hand.</p>
<p>It was a knife!</p>
<p>Evidently one of the Indians, when cutting up the
meat, had accidentally dropped it.</p>
<p>Somewhat awkwardly, for his hand was tightly
bound, he managed to clutch the blade in such a manner
that after persistent effort he succeeded in cutting
his bonds.</p>
<p>His joy at the sense of freedom almost made him
faint when he found himself clear. Quietly and slowly,
it seemed as if the beating of his heart must waken
the savages, he got possession of one of the rifles. He
knew that a snapping twig would probably mean his
destruction. He had heard of captives, who, in such
straits as his, had slain their captors while they slept.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
The thought was revolting to him. Cautiously creeping
away into the outer darkness, it seemed hours before
he dared press forward without fear of making a
noise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A WILD FLIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>Many a time in his wild flight that memorable
night the boy thought what good fortune it
was that the sky was clear and the moon
shining. By its light he was able to make good progress
and avoid walking in a circle, as otherwise he
doubtless would have done.</p>
<p>He directed his course toward the east, with the
moon slightly on his right. Many a fall he had over
slippery, moss-grown logs, and his face was bleeding
from scratches received while rushing through the
bushes. He could not conceal his trail, hoping to do
that by daylight. During the night he must make
every effort to travel as fast and as far as possible.</p>
<p>His nerves were at the utmost tension. He realized
that any moment he might hear a yell or see some
shadowy form glide alongside. The instant an Indian
awoke and discovered his escape the chase would
begin.</p>
<p>The picture of the poor fellow murdered back at the
creek was before his eyes and the horror of it spurred
him to his utmost. Just at dawn he arrived at a small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
stream so nearly exhausted that he stumbled and fell
while crossing it, yet he dared not stop to rest. He
must first conceal his trail, which up to this place the
savages could easily follow.</p>
<p>After crossing he walked a short distance alongside
on the bank down stream, leaving plain imprints of his
feet in the soft soil. Then he again entered the water
and turned up stream.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour he forced himself onward,
stumbling over the slippery rocks and not once leaving
the water. Finally he came to a bare ledge jutting
into the brook. He stepped from the water to this,
careful to leave no imprints of his feet. At the farther
end was a fallen tree. Walking along the trunk of
this as far as he could, he stooped to the ground and
rejoiced to note that it was firm, so that his moccasins
left no impress on it. One who has never tried the
experiment cannot realize the care necessary in walking
through the woods not to displace a leaf or break
a twig, which would attract the attention of a wary
savage.</p>
<p>Rodney succeeded so well that, after he had gone
nearly half a mile and came to a dense clump of underbrush,
he decided it would be safe to hide there and
sleep. He believed the Indians would think he had fled
in the direction of the Ohio River, and, seeing his footprints
on the bank, would follow down stream. He
could not remember when he had been so tired and
soon was in a sound slumber, not waking till nearly
noon. He was very hungry but found a spring of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
sweet water and some checkerberry leaves, and, thus
refreshed, continued his flight.</p>
<p>He did not rest again till nightfall. He had seen no
game save squirrels and, having but one load for his
rifle, hesitated to waste that on small game. From the
first he had thought his only chance of escape would be
to follow some stream flowing in the direction of the
Ohio. At dusk he came to one and concluded it now
safe to follow it, but soon he must eat, for he was very
weak.</p>
<p>Selecting a convenient place he sat down to wait for
a chance glimpse of game. Possibly a deer might
come that way to drink, and a deer would be worth
his one bullet. Rodney by this time concluded his
pursuers had lost his trail and he felt as though he
were alone in the great forest. His eyelids were heavy,
but, recalling what happened to him through falling
asleep three days before, he rose to his feet the better to
keep awake. As he did so he was startled by a shot,
fired a little way down the stream.</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s eyelids were no longer heavy. He experienced
something like a chill and he asked himself,
&#8220;What if I had seen game and fired?&#8221; After waiting
a few moments, it occurred to him that there was a
possibility that the shot had been fired by white men.
Of course it was improbable, but he must investigate.
If they were Indians, they would gorge themselves with
the meat and sleep soundly so that he ought to have no
trouble in getting past them. Moreover, unless many
were in the party, they would leave a portion of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
carcass if it were a deer they had shot. Why might he
not secure that? He was hungry enough to eat the
flesh raw.</p>
<p>Cautiously approaching he finally saw the gleam of
firelight among the trees and then shadows of men, and
his heart sank. They were Indians! Two came up to
the fire from the stream and the boy noted the direction
whence they came. After the moon appeared he
entered the brook to descend it and look about for
signs of the place where the game was killed. At last
he found it, and the carcass of a deer from which the
hind quarters had been cut. Quick work with his knife
secured him a goodly portion of what was left and with
this he hurried on down the brook, on the slippery
bed of which he kept his footing with difficulty.
His hunger urged him so that after going about a
mile he decided he was far enough away to risk a
fire.</p>
<p>He gathered a lot of dried twigs and rubbed them
between his palms, thus making a small powdery mass
into which, after mixing with it a few grains of powder
from the priming, he struck sparks from the flint and
steel of his rifle. The smell of the cooking meat made
him ravenous and, like an Indian, he ate it half raw.
He then lost no time in extinguishing his fire and
renewing his journey.</p>
<p>The good food and the reflection that so far he had
outwitted the savages, put him in a very happy frame
of mind. He was congratulating himself on his good
luck when he heard a dry twig snap in the dense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
growth beside the brook. It was a moment of horror
for the lad and he instantly crouched in the shadow of
the bushes and cocked his rifle. The noise continued, a
shuffling sound, and then his straining ears detected
the snuffing of some animal. One may imagine his
relief.</p>
<p>The animal soon emerged from the bushes, a black,
shaggy bulk with muzzle uplifted, following the scent
of the meat which Rodney carried.</p>
<p>Now, being followed by a hungry bear under such
conditions would not be agreeable to most people, but
the boy&#8217;s courage was good and his relief at finding his
pursuer not an Indian was so great that he felt like
laughing; instead he hastened his pace.</p>
<p>The chase continued, mile after mile, though to the
tired lad stumbling over the slippery stones it seemed
league upon league. Occasionally he stepped in a hole
to his waist, but he was too excited to heed the drenching
or the fatigue.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and bruin yet followed. &#8220;Reckon
he&#8217;s hungry as I am,&#8221; Rodney remarked to himself.
Then came the thought, why not divide with the bear?
Suiting action to word the lad quickly cut his meat in
two pieces, flinging one behind. With a growl the
brute savagely seized it and the boy hurried on. The
respite was brief, however, for not many minutes
passed before he heard his pursuer, appetite whetted
by what he had eaten, following the trail.</p>
<p>Rodney was now more exasperated than frightened.
The dangers through which he had passed seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
embolden him, though he knew his plight would indeed
be unpleasant should he attempt to shoot bruin and by
some cause miss fire. The muskets sold to the Indians
were usually of the cheapest quality, and the one he
carried certainly appeared to be of that variety. He
looked behind. The bear was gaining. Seeing this,
the lad resolved on extreme measures. First, he would
try the effect of a rock and he picked one up, about as
large as his two fists.</p>
<p>Rodney had thrown many stones in his life and most
of them had been well aimed. This was no exception
and landed fairly on bruin&#8217;s snout. The animal stood
on the bank not twenty feet distant and he turned a
somersault, in his pain and rage, landing in the water
with a loud splash.</p>
<p>Young Allison did not stop to laugh, as he felt like
doing, but put as much distance between himself and
his pursuer as possible. After a time, hearing nothing
of bruin, he concluded the old fellow had given up the
chase and lay somewhere curled up and nursing his
sore snout. Now that the excitement was past the boy
began to be sensible of his fatigue. Nature was asserting
herself and he must eat and sleep.</p>
<p>Just at dawn he noted a clear space among large
trees on a knoll a little way from the brook, which now
had grown to a considerable creek. He reconnoitred
and, finding no trace of an enemy, built a fire. While
broiling a piece of the venison it occurred to him that
he should husband what was left of the meat as it
might be a long time before he could find venison,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
killed and dressed by Indians, awaiting him along the
route. Accordingly, after eating a hearty breakfast,
he cut crotched sticks and drove them into the ground
on either side of the fire and placed green poles across,
over the fire. By hanging the meat on these he planned
to smoke and dry what remained, after cutting it into
strips. Rodney seemed to forget about both Indians
and the bear and was whistling softly as he worked
when a noise behind him caused him to turn.</p>
<p>Not over fifteen feet away was the bear! He smelled
the cooking meat and evidently was in an ugly mood.
Scarcely thinking what he did, the boy, snatching a
brand from the fire, threw it full in the face of the
brute and sprang for his rifle. The firebrand only
seemed to infuriate the animal and he charged.
Hastily Rodney fired.</p>
<p>A growl of rage and pain followed the report, and
through the clearing smoke the boy saw the bear
biting at the wound in his side. Round and round
bruin whirled until he caught a glimpse of his assailant,
when he rushed forward. As in a haze the boy
saw the huge bulk almost upon him, the little fiery
eyes gleaming like coals of fire, the open jaws flecked
with bloody froth. The boy clubbed his rifle with no
thought of running. The bear rose on his hind legs.
One blow from his powerful paw, and all would be
over. Rodney struck, shattering the stock of the gun,
and sprang aside. He now was helpless!</p>
<p>The bear, full of fight, struck, his claws ripping the
boy&#8217;s sleeve. Crack! A well-aimed shot from behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
brought bruin down with scarcely a struggle and the
huge bulk lay stretched at Rodney&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>A child&#8217;s scream of delight followed the shot. A
white boy of about ten years, accompanied by an
Indian, came out of the thick woods, the little fellow
crying, &#8220;He&#8217;s mine. I want him, Caughnega.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this pleading the Indian paid no heed. Confronting
Rodney he demanded, with a sweep of his
arm: &#8220;Pale face no hunt; Indian country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney, by this time, was in a somewhat hysterical
condition. The idea that he was there for the pleasure
or profit of hunting bears struck him as so ludicrous
that he laughed loudly, a performance that evidently
puzzled the redskin not a little.</p>
<p>The little fellow here renewed his plea, saying: &#8220;I
saw him first and I want him to play with; he&#8217;s mine,&#8221;
and he stamped his foot like a petty tyrant and seized
Rodney by the hand, saying, &#8220;You&#8217;ll play with
Louis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be very glad to do so,&#8221; Rodney replied, looking
at the Indian rather than at the boy who tugged at
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No hunt, what for here?&#8221; the Indian asked and his
voice was stern.</p>
<p>Rodney hesitated a moment. The red man&#8217;s beady
eyes, noting this, glittered. &#8220;I&#8217;m lost,&#8221; Rodney finally
said, adding, &#8220;I want to get back to the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; And, having thus expressed himself,
Caughnega turned to the work of skinning and cutting
up the bear, in which task Rodney endeavoured to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
assist, his efforts, however, being received quite ungraciously.</p>
<p>When all was done, the meat was tied into two
bundles, one of which the Indian ordered Rodney to
take and walk ahead. Now, walking ahead of a hostile
savage is not a pleasant arrangement, but the boy tried
to comfort himself with the thought that, so long as
the Indian might wish the bundle carried, he would not
kill the carrier. Then the little fellow ran alongside
and took the older lad&#8217;s hand, an act of confidence and
friendship the latter never forgot.</p>
<p>They forded the creek and climbed the bank to a
small plateau overlooking a meadow through which
the creek wound its way. Here, on this high land,
were clustered about twenty huts or wigwams, some
covered with skins and others with bark. As no one
expected them, their approach did not excite especial
commotion, fortunately for Rodney, otherwise he
might have been compelled to run a gauntlet.</p>
<p>Caughnega stopped in front of one of the wigwams
and motioned Rodney to enter.</p>
<p>Louis protested, saying, &#8220;He is mine, I found him,&#8221;
but to no avail. Disappointed, he ran away, crying
bitterly, while the scowling savage flung his prisoner
into the hut, and indicated by word and gesture that
the lad was not to leave it on peril of his life. Then
he stalked away, and Rodney was left to the bitterness
of his reflections.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>LISBETH WRITES FROM LONDON</h3>
</div>
<p>From the filthy wigwam, into which Rodney
Allison had been thrust by his captor, to the
little home in Charlottesville the distance was
more than three hundred miles, as the crow flies, and
much farther for those that travelled on foot and not
by wing, threading the winding forest trails, wading
and swimming the fords and climbing the mountains.
Yet the lad&#8217;s thoughts sped across like a flash of dawn.</p>
<p>He lifted his head&ndash;&ndash;his surroundings had, for the
moment, cast the spell of despair on him&ndash;&ndash;and looked
out. He seemed to see, not the woods that hemmed
in the little Indian village, but his humble home in far
away Virginia. Poor and shabby outside, inside, the
&#8220;living&#8221; room was as neat as soap and water and
sand and plenty of scrubbing could make it. The
meagre furnishings were tidily arranged. He could
see, &#8220;in his mind&#8217;s eye,&#8221; the faces of his mother, and
Mam, and Thello; fancied he could hear the whinny
with which Nat always greeted his entrance to the
stable. He imagined just what familiar task each of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
them might be doing. He knew Thello&#8217;s forehead was
wrinkled, as always when working, that Mam was
humming a melody, and his mother&#8217;s face was anxious.
He could not know that she stood by the west window
looking out toward the mountains and thinking of him
and his father; nor could he see black Sam stop at the
door and with an air of importance give to the &#8220;Missus&#8221;
a letter, dingy and worn by its long journey
across the ocean, the negro scraping and bowing as
he did so.</p>
<p>Sam was saying: &#8220;Squar, he says, &#8216;Sam, you done
tote dat yar letter right smart to Missus Allison wid
my bes&#8217; respec&#8217;s. She&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217; ter read it.&#8217; Spec&#8217;s
it&#8217;s from Lunnon. Squar, he jes&#8217; home from Willumsburg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sam. The squire is indeed kind, and
you will say that Mrs. Allison thanks him for his kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>To most people the arrival of any letter was an important
event in those days, especially one from &#8220;the
old country,&#8221; six long weeks by sailing vessel at best.
Moreover, at that time, there was only a weekly mail
between Philadelphia and Williamsburg, unless sent
by special messenger, and then on to its destination by
any chance carrier, each person along the route being
helpful in forwarding it. So it was not surprising that
Mrs. Allison eagerly opened the letter, breaking what
she recognized as the Danesford seal.</p>
<p>The ink on that letter has dimmed with the long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
years, but time has not obliterated a certain daintiness
in the writing, for Lisbeth&#8217;s innate grace was somehow
transmitted through the quill pen to the neat, clear
characters fashioned by her hand. The reading of it,
too, will assist the reader to a better understanding of
the girl and the conditions surrounding her, and Lisbeth
was a girl worth knowing, though she may yet
need excuses, and those will be the more easily made
after reading.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Aunt Harriet</span>:&ndash;&ndash;I know you keep promises
and so I address you as &#8216;aunt.&#8217; I&#8217;m sure you remember
one day when I came to you in tears. I didn&#8217;t
often come that way, did I? I was so lonely, I&#8217;ll never
forget how lonely, just because it suddenly occurred to
me that most little girls had mothers and aunts, and
I had never seen one that belonged to me. You took
me in your arms and said you would be my aunt, that
you had been thinking how nice it would be to have a
little girl for a niece, and I went home comforted and
actually believing you had wanted me for a niece all
the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got a real aunt now, Aunt Mogridge,
and sometimes I think neither of us is real glad it is
so. I&#8217;m a wicked girl for writing that, and would
scratch it out only I somehow want you to know how
I feel. She is just as kind as any aunt could be, but,
well, she doesn&#8217;t care for the things I do, and&ndash;&ndash;vice
versa, as the books say. Now, while I&#8217;m sighing for
a glimpse of the Old Dominion, and papa, and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
and&ndash;&ndash;and all of them, Aunt Mogridge is sighing because
she can&#8217;t have a new dress for Lady D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;s
to-morrow night, and worrying lest I say something
I ought not to, because there is to be a real live duke
there. I have met dukes before, and found them very
uninteresting, although I suppose there are various
kinds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What wouldn&#8217;t I give, this dismal afternoon, to
jump on the back of Moleskin and ride like the wind
and hear solemn old Jeremiah clattering behind, his
black face turned white with fear lest I fall off! Instead
I&#8217;ve been listening to old Lady Brendon retail
the latest gossip. She&#8217;s a wheezy old lady, so fat her
chairmen&#8217;s faces always shine with perspiration, and
all she cares about is the latest gossip: &#8216;Lord So-and-So
has wagered his last farthing at White&#8217;s or
the Chocolate House,&#8217; until I want to say, like black
Susan, &#8216;Jolly fuss!&#8217; You should have heard Aunt
Mogridge tell Lady Brendon about what a rich man
papa is. I used to think, to hear him talk, that if the
crops failed he&#8217;d never be able to pay his debts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the king at the theatre the other night. He
looks just like some of the German farmers papa and
I saw in Pennsylvania. They say he is very pious, and
frowns on gambling, as well he might for the good of
his kingdom, and that he is determined to do as his
mother told him and be a real king. He doesn&#8217;t look
as though he&#8217;d exactly know how. You should have
heard him laugh over a little silly joke, when one of
the actors sat in a chair on a make-believe baby and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
a ventriloquist squalled just like a baby. But they
says he&#8217;s obstinate and the colonies can&#8217;t make him
yield to their demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;People here think just as dear papa does, that
England has helped fight the battles of the colonies
and protect them with the strong arm of England&ndash;&ndash;I
tell &#8217;em there are strong arms in the colonies&ndash;&ndash;and
that they should help pay the taxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all too profound for me, though I am sixteen
and should be, they tell me, a dignified young lady.
Indeed aunt is planning to have me introduced at court.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell you what a bore little Lord Nobury is
getting to be. It&#8217;s partly Aunt Mogridge&#8217;s fault.
Anything with a title she loves and, though she deplores
the way young men gamble, and I think her
beautiful son&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s yet in Virginia, thank Heaven&ndash;&ndash;hasn&#8217;t
much money to squander, she boasts of his
losses at &#8216;hazard&#8217; to Lord Nobury.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the first specimen, Nobury, I mean, that
I met. I hadn&#8217;t been at aunt&#8217;s more than a day before
he called. I&#8217;d been awfully seasick on the voyage and
the sight of him nearly brought on another attack.
It seemed that aunt had been singing my praises to him
before I arrived. Well, he bowed very low and, had
he remained in that posture, I might have liked him,
for his clothes were gorgeous; a coat of creamy velvet,
a wonderful waistcoat with gold embroidery, black
velvet breeches, white silk stockings, shoes with gold
buckles and the lace at his wrists and neck was so fine
I was actually envious.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He began to talk right away about the theatres.
Of course I was so ignorant of it all that I could only
listen. He said I must see Garrick at the Drury Lane
and I hope I may.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little &#8216;macaroni&#8217; is so short that he wears
very high heels and has his hair done up high in front.
You ought to see the wonderful and fearful things they
do with their hair, both ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>&#8220;After learning I didn&#8217;t know anything about the
theatres, though of course I had read about them at
home, he seemed at a loss what to talk about, and his
face looked so blank and pasty I wished old Doctor
Atterbury could have been there to prescribe for his
liver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned the conversation to horses by telling him
I thought those in the Old Dominion were much superior
to those in England and then went on to tell him
about the time I got on Moleskin&#8217;s back against orders
and how he ran away with me when he heard the baying
of Squire Dupont&#8217;s hounds. The little lord declared
with a smirk that I must have looked like an
aboriginal Indian princess. I asked him why not rather
like an original one, and he stared and fingered his
little sword; a sword on such as he makes me wonder
how black Tom would look in the beadle&#8217;s wig. But
here am I running on about lords and ladies when I
hate the sound of their names and am wishing I were
back in Virginia where the sunshine isn&#8217;t strained
through fog and the logs burning in the big fireplaces,
are fragrant and cheerful.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Naomi is a big girl and so you won&#8217;t
feel the need of nieces to write long letters about nothing.
Is Rodney talking war? Poor papa, he was
worrying, when I left him in New York, about the
talk being made against our rightful sovereign.
Well, I now will write him a long, cheerful letter, so
thank you for being an aunt to me once more.</p>
<p class='ralign'>   &#8220;Your ob&#8217;t and affectionate niece,<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span><br />
          &#8220;<span class='smcap'>Elizabeth Danesford.</span>&#8221;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did she but know it, her father stood in need of
cheerful letters, for the bitterness of the rising war
spirit was daily making feuds between former friends,
and all who talked loyalty to the king and condemned
Henry, Jefferson and Washington soon discovered
they were champions of an unpopular cause.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE CHIEF WHO DEMANDED THE TRUTH</h3>
</div>
<p>Four days of intense excitement, without proper
food or sleep, subjected to peril of life, would
test the hardiest person. Rodney Allison felt
like breaking down and weeping hysterically. To add
to his discomfort he believed the hut to be alive with
vermin, not an uncommon condition in any Indian&#8217;s
wigwam, and this one looked filthy.</p>
<p>His unpleasant reflections were interrupted by the
return of the little boy, Louis, who cried, &#8220;Ahneota,
he say you come right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The redskin who threw me in here said he would
kill me if I left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ce n&#8217;est rien</i>, Ahneota says come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the circumstances Rodney decided to run the
risk, for evidently the little chap was the only friend
he had found, so he said, &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t want me
killed, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Non.</i> I will have you to play with me. Ahneota
is my friend. He will give you to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went to a wigwam at the farther end of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
village and found awaiting them an old chief. He
was tall and gaunt. His face was long, the nose
sharply aquiline, and his eyes were as keen and bright
as those of a youth. The chief&#8217;s manner was very,
dignified, even stern. Louis began his plea, but was
ordered to call the Indian, Caughnega. Then, turning
to Rodney, the chief asked: &#8220;Why come to Indian
country and kill game? White man&#8217;s game below big
river.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney hesitated. What could he say? He feared
to confess that he already had escaped from Indians,
it would not be a helpful introduction, to say the least;
neither would he lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was lost and hungry. The bear was hungry, too.
I had to shoot,&#8221; he finally said.</p>
<p>The searching look of the Indian embarrassed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pigeon dropped by the eagle spoke not truth
but said he fell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney flushed under the fierce gaze of the bright
eyes of the aged chief. Then lifting his head he resolutely
replied: &#8220;I have told you the truth, but not all
of it. I am here through no fault of my own and am
trying to get back to the big river and my people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The big river is many days&#8217; journey. There is
blood on the pigeon,&#8221; replied Ahneota, pointing to
Rodney&#8217;s wrists, which yet bore the marks of the
thongs with which he had been bound.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the work of Indians. I was on my way
down the Ohio to meet my father near the Great
Kanawha. The party I was with landed for supper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
and was attacked by Indians, who killed some and
made me a prisoner. I escaped from them and am
here. Neither I nor my father ever wronged an
Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The land north of the big river belongs to the
Indian. The Great Father gave it to the Indian and
the palefaces smoked the pipe of peace with the red
man. Now they would come and kill our game and
the red man must die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our party was not seeking land north of the river
when the Indians cruelly attacked us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Wyandottes are at peace with the Shawnees
and do not take away their captives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You all are at peace with the whites and have no
right to make me a prisoner,&#8221; was Rodney&#8217;s reply, so
boldly spoken he feared its effect might be bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young braves will not always obey their chiefs,&#8221;
was the rather evasive reply of the old man, and the
boy instinctively felt he had not displeased Ahneota by
his bold speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahneota has one brother. He left the palefaces
and is an Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy understood this to mean that he might,
by forsaking his people, find safety as a member of the
tribe. Every tie of affection bound him to his own
people. He knew, moreover, that if an adopted member
of the tribe ever deserted it the offence was
regarded as a most serious one; that on the contrary
he would be expected, if need be, to fight against his
own people. He made no reply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Will paleface be Ahneota&#8217;s brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thought of home almost brought tears to the boy&#8217;s
eyes. He gulped down his emotion, for he knew the
Indians look with contempt on any display of one&#8217;s
feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be deserting my people,&#8221; he finally replied.
&#8220;My father and mother and sister are living.
I thank you for the&ndash;&ndash;the kindness. I hope you will
permit me to go to them. My people are at peace with
your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The palefaces speak words of peace but their deeds
are war.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments and then the
old chief spoke with Rodney&#8217;s captor. They talked in
the Indian tongue. Little Louis, standing by, evidently
knew what they were saying, for, as the Indian
who claimed Rodney spoke more loudly, he interrupted,
claiming, as afterward appeared, that the
prisoner was his, that he had first seen him and
wanted him for a playmate.</p>
<p>The old Indian did not speak for a time, evidently
being puzzled what to do. Then, addressing Rodney,
he said: &#8220;Young paleface will not be the Indian&#8217;s
brother; he cannot find his way to the big river. He
may share the Indian&#8217;s lodge and meat.&#8221; Saying this
he turned and entered his lodge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Louis who spoke and, taking Rodney by the
hand, he led him away, while Caughnega, with a sullen
look on his face, went his way.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>Louis was a handsome little fellow, affectionate in
his manner and delighted with his success in obtaining
a new playfellow. As they went along they met one
that at first Rodney thought to be an Indian but on
closer inspection decided was a white man; the fellow
was, in fact, none other than Conrad, whose capture
has already been related.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Conrad! <i>mon ami</i>. I have a new friend,&#8221;
exclaimed Louis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are one of his old ones,&#8221; remarked
Rodney with a smile. Conrad made no reply, but
looked inquiringly while Louis rattled off an account
of the events of the morning.</p>
<p>The news did not appear to be agreeable to Conrad,
who walked away without comment; but the little
fellow was too full of the novelty of his experiences to
heed Conrad&#8217;s manner, and they went on to a lodge
on the edge of the village and Louis led his companion
into where, seated on a bear skin, was a woman
weaving mats out of rushes. She looked up quickly,
and Rodney saw at a glance that she was superior to
any Indian women he had ever seen, evidently a half-breed.
The blanket she wore and her surroundings
looked clean, and her face showed intelligence much
beyond the ordinary; but there was something in
the look she gave him that warned Rodney she would
be his implacable enemy.</p>
<p>The little fellow&#8217;s tongue ran on in a mingled
jargon of French, Indian and English and Rodney
comprehended, rather from the looks and gestures of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
the woman and child than from the words, that Louis
was determined the newcomer should live with them,
while she objected, whereat Louis began to wail imperiously,
and the glance of dislike she gave Rodney
was not reassuring.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will build a lodge, you can show me how to do
it, and then you can have one more home to go to,&#8221;
said Rodney, trying to soothe the troubled feelings.
This idea pleased Louis, who dried his eyes and was
for beginning on it right away, but &#8220;Maman,&#8221; as he
called the half-breed woman, did not appear to like this
plan any better than the first, and her beady eyes
snapped ominously; but she said nothing. Rodney
wished he might lie down on one of the clean mats before
him and sleep, for he was so tired he scarcely
could keep awake even while walking. He shrank
from asking the woman for a place to sleep, but finally
did so, and she grunted assent.</p>
<p>While Rodney slept the sleep of exhaustion, Louis
went in search of Conrad, and asked him to build his
new friend a wigwam.</p>
<p>Conrad scowled and replied that the new boy
wouldn&#8217;t live long enough to need it, and Louis cried,
&#8220;They can&#8217;t kill him, Ahneota won&#8217;t let them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vat for you vant him, yet? Conrad your friend
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want him, too; he&#8217;s white like Jules. Papa
said: &#8216;Jules is a good boy and you may play with him
all day.&#8217; You don&#8217;t play with me all the time, but go
away hunting and will not let me go, too.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He need will have to eat, und to hunt, I tink,
alretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis was so insistent that Conrad finally assisted
him in cutting poles for the proposed wigwam and
setting them in place. By this time Rodney, who had
been waked by the woman, joined them and worked
as hard as his sore muscles would permit. By night
he had a shelter of bark and boughs. Louis brought a
mat and there the weary captive lay down for the
night, hungry and sore. Later, the little fellow
brought him some dried venison and showed him
the spring that supplied the village with drinking
water.</p>
<p>The following morning Rodney chanced to see the
half-breed, &#8220;Maman,&#8221; as Louis called her, though
Rodney felt sure she was not his mother, talking
very earnestly with Caughnega and their talk ceased
when he approached, which aroused his suspicion.
He made inquiries of Louis and learned that Caughnega
was the &#8220;medicine man&#8221; of the village and
possessed influence. Ahneota was the more influential
and the boy shrewdly guessed that Caughnega
was jealous.</p>
<p>A chief of a tribe maintained his influence through
no laws, for the Indians had none. The position might
be strengthened by the chief having influential relatives,
but this did not appear to be true of Ahneota.
Generally speaking, a chief retained his place because
the tribe trusted and respected him, as it was evident
they did Ahneota. Not only members of his tribe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
but other Indians, came and held counsel with him.
At first Rodney hesitated about calling on the chief
but gradually became a daily visitor at his lodge.</p>
<p>One of the accomplishments which Rodney had
learned from Thello was fishing. When leaving home
he had taken a good linen line and several iron hooks.
Indians speared or netted most of the fish they took,
but occasionally angled for them with bone hooks and
lines made of twisted fibre. The boy obtained permission
to fish and in this way often contributed to
the food supply of the village.</p>
<p>Food was held in common. Any one having it was
expected to share equally with the others. When luck
smiled on the boy he was careful to have a nicely
broiled fish to take to Ahneota. He also attempted to
make friends with Conrad but always met with a surly
reception.</p>
<p>Louis was so friendly as to be almost a nuisance,
especially as Rodney believed the little fellow&#8217;s fondness
for him was a cause for the dislike of Conrad
and &#8220;Maman.&#8221; The little boy, whenever he could
escape the watchfulness of &#8220;Maman&#8221; would pay a
visit to Rodney&#8217;s wigwam, which had been made quite
substantial, being covered with strips of elm bark.
Louis was always clamouring for stories about white
people and one evening, Rodney replied: &#8220;I have told
you all my stories. Now you must tell me some; tell
me of the place where you lived before you came here.
Is &#8216;Maman&#8217; your real mother and is your father
living?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>A startled look came into the lad&#8217;s big brown eyes.
He peered about in the growing dusk, then he said:
&#8220;You will not tell? Maman says she will kill me if I
tell. Maman is not my mother. She had eyes like
flowers and papa, he was <i>gentilhomme</i>, would carry
her in his arms when she was sick. He was tall like
Ahneota, only his eyes were not so black. Mamma
called him her soldier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he now?&#8221; asked Rodney, thoroughly
interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went away after mamma died and I went to
live with <i>grandmere</i> above Lachine. Marie, that&#8217;s
Maman, she says I must call her that, she was a
servant for <i>grandmere</i>, who died last harvest. She
was not sick a long time like mamma, but only a few
days. Marie said it was small-pox, and we must go
away and find papa, but we have not found him. I
want to see my papa,&#8221; and Louis threw himself sobbing
on the ground.</p>
<p>Rodney stroked his long yellow hair and called him
&#8220;Yellow Locks,&#8221; but the little chap peevishly exclaimed,
&#8220;I like Louis better. I don&#8217;t want to be called
&#8216;Yellow Locks.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint noise behind caused Rodney to turn quickly.
There stood Marie, the half-breed!</p>
<p>How much had she heard? the boy asked himself;
but he was learning to control his feelings, and he said
pleasantly enough, &#8220;Good evening, Maman. Louis is
tired and I reckon wants to be in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to sleep here,&#8221; exclaimed the child.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; replied Rodney. &#8220;You are too
tired and the bed in Maman&#8217;s lodge is softer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the little chap up in her arms and carried
him away. It was evident she was fond of him, which
might account for her having stolen him, as it appeared
she had; also for her jealousy. What would be
the end of the muddle? Rodney asked himself. He
thought of the stake and the frenzied villagers dancing
around the fire with blood-curdling yells. Would he
be able to endure the torture? He hoped so, for the
boy was proud of his race. But why borrow trouble?
All around him were signs of peace and savage contentment.
The little camp-fires twinkled in the gathering
dusk. Some of the squaws sang bits of a wild
lullaby to their children and he could hear, in droning
refrain:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Wau, wau, tee, say.<br />
Wau, wau, tee, say,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>sung as a lullaby by one of the squaws, who had slung
the wicker-work frame, into which the papoose was
strapped, across the limb of a tree and swung it back
and forth while she sang, as one would rock a cradle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little mummy,&#8221; thought Rodney. &#8220;No
wonder Indians can endure pain. Tied into that framework
straight as an arrow and unable to brush away
a mosquito or help themselves, they ought to learn to
endure anything.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A WHITE BOY ADOPTED BY THE INDIANS</h3>
</div>
<p>It already has appeared that Conrad&#8217;s wish that he
might be adopted by the Indians, a thought which
comforted him as he lay bound on the first night
of his captivity, had been realized; also that he had
been adopted by the old chief, Ahneota, who now
wished to adopt Rodney.</p>
<p>As Conrad&#8217;s experiences were such as the other lad
might expect, should he finally yield to the old Indian&#8217;s
desire, a brief account of them may be found interesting.</p>
<p>Following the night of Conrad&#8217;s capture the party
travelled for two days in a westerly direction. Just
at dusk on the second day they came to a small river.
Here canoes were brought from hiding and all, save
one Indian who swam across with the horse, paddled
to the other side in the canoes.</p>
<p>Arriving on the other bank several guns were discharged,
followed by lusty yells that soon were responded
to with like yells from over a wooded ridge
near the river. Within a few minutes squaws and
papooses came running to meet them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>Though Conrad was a stolid lad his pulse quickened,
for he had heard many tales of tortures inflicted by the
savages. The Indian dogs snapped at his heels; the
children and some of the squaws tormented him by
pinching, slapping and threatening, to all of which the
men paid no heed and the boy tried to appear indifferent.</p>
<p>As they came near the village all the spectators
formed in two lines, between which he was ordered to
run.</p>
<p>He was to run the gauntlet! For an instant his
heart stopped beating, the next, a sharp blow from a
stick set the blood inherited from a brave ancestry
tingling through his veins.</p>
<p>Lowering his head he charged, as a mad bull
charges, warding off what blows he might with his
sturdy arms. He was thwacked with clubs, jabbed
with sharpened sticks, tripped and pommelled till it
seemed that not an inch of his body escaped. One old
hag threw a handful of sand in his eyes and he
stumbled, but crawled the few feet remaining between
where he fell and the wigwam toward which he had
run. Once inside, his tormentors left him. He was so
sore that he almost wished he could die. After a time
he slept and thought his mother came to comfort him,
but it was only a young squaw who brought him food.
Then one of the men came and the boy complained of
the rough treatment. The Indian said that running
the gauntlet was the custom, that he had been brave
and the Indians would adopt him into the tribe, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
Conrad could have cried for joy, only that he was a
boy who did not cry.</p>
<p>Conrad never forgot the day he was formally
adopted into the tribe. First in the ceremony was
washing away his white blood and, it seemed to the
boy, at least a part of his skin as well.</p>
<p>In full view of the assembled tribe, whose ideas of
modesty differed much from those of civilized people,
he was stripped and led into a pool in the river and
there thrust under the water and then stood upon his
feet and scoured with sand. This was the most thorough
scrubbing Conrad ever was to have. Life with
the Vuysens had not been conducive to cleanliness and
Indians in those days were not noted for bathing.</p>
<p>Following the bath came the process of greasing him
from head to foot and decorating his face with
pigments, after which he was clad in breech-clout and
moccasins. This done, he was seated upon the bank
for a no less severe ordeal.</p>
<p>This consisted in plucking out the hair of his head,
all but a tuft, or scalp lock, to which coloured feathers
were tied. An Indian did the work, dipping his fingers
in ashes that he might get better hold. Conrad
never winced or made outcry throughout the various
ordeals.</p>
<p>A blanket was given to the boy, who was then led
into a wigwam, where an old Indian conducted
ceremonies, on which Conrad looked with awe, though
understanding but little of them. Their solemnity,
however, impressed him deeply and it is very doubtful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
whether, after they were over, he would have dared
run away had he been so inclined.</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes were light blue and his hair was
yellow; but his cheekbones were high, his face stolid,
so that now, when paint and grease had been added
to sunburn, and he stood clothed in full Indian garb, no
one would think him other than an Indian but for
those tell-tale blue eyes.</p>
<p>The Wyandottes, of which people he now considered
himself one, occupied territory in what is now the
north-central portion of Ohio.</p>
<p>The year was 1772, not long ago in history, but
measured by change, very long ago. Then, the country
was little different from what it had been for thousands
of years. Now, it seems another world and the map
of it shows great cities where were forests and connecting
these are what at first resemble spiders&#8217; webs,
but which are highways. Few white men then came
to that region, where now few red men are seen, indeed
none living the life they then lived. Such whites as
came were a few French voyageurs and Jesuit missionaries
and hunters and traders from the English
colonies. The traders did not scruple to exchange, for
valuable furs, guns, tomahawks and ammunition,
which they knew would be turned against the whites
of the frontier in time of war; and many of them sold
the savages liquor, knowing an Indian would sell his
soul for it and having drank it would become a fiend
incarnate.</p>
<p>On the south flowed the Ohio River, along which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
white men were pushing their way, and settling on land
in what is now Kentucky and Tennessee, and looking
with covetous eyes on the land between that river and
the lakes, but which the Indians claimed had been
reserved to them by treaty. The shrewder among the
Indian leaders foresaw the time when they would have
to fight and overwhelm the intruders or submit to
their hunting grounds being spoiled by the white man.
This feeling of uneasiness was spreading among the
tribes, and the younger warriors were eager to fight
and not infrequently were guilty of marauding expeditions.</p>
<p>One day a party of young braves had returned from
a hunting expedition down in what was called &#8220;the
dark and bloody ground,&#8221; Kentucky, which the Indians
of the North and the Cherokees and Chickasaws of
the South made common use of for a hunting place.
Frequent were the bloody skirmishes fought by these
hostile tribes in this territory, though none of the Indians
made permanent homes there. This party had
brought back several scalps and among them Conrad
noted two torn from the heads of white men. Ahneota
had looked grave and the boy shuddered, and for the
first time his dreams about his future were not as
bright as they had been.</p>
<p>One day there had come to the village a Frenchman,
clad in the picturesque garb of a voyageur, wearing a
gaudy handkerchief about his head and a gay capote,
or blanket coat which the savages much admired.
With him was a half-breed woman and Louis, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
not quite ten years old. Conrad thought this boy the
most attractive person he had ever met and the little
fellow, clad in the softest of deerskin tastefully ornamented
and wearing a jaunty cap of the same material,
was indeed a handsome lad. Conrad had attached
himself to the boy as does a dog to his master. When
Rodney arrived, and the little fellow preferred him to
his former companion, then Conrad, who in one year of
the wild life had become an Indian in looks, became
one at heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>HATING, BUT WAITING</h3>
</div>
<p>Ahneota was an Indian of superior intelligence
and varied experience. As the summer
advanced, and the corn and tobacco which the
squaws had planted in the meadow put forth glossy
leaves and promise of the harvest, the boy&#8217;s visits to
the old chief became more interesting as well as more
frequent. Rodney recognized in him his only safety
and instinctively knew that the Indian liked him.</p>
<p>The more he learned of the aged man&#8217;s wisdom and
his kindness toward the people of the village, the
greater his wonder at the ferocious expression in the
face of this savage when persuaded to recount his
exploits. There could be no mistaking that this otherwise
kindly old man bore the whites a bitter hatred,
though more tolerant of the French than of the
English.</p>
<p>In his youth Ahneota had been taught by a Jesuit
missionary, indeed had been regarded as a convert.
He had retained, however, many of the superstitions
of the savage; believed in all sorts of evil as well as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
good spirits, thought animals had spirit existence
after death, had faith in dreams, and, though he had
little to do with the arts of the &#8220;medicine man,&#8221; so
great was his dislike of Caughnega, Rodney became
convinced the chief also believed in them, to some
extent, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;The French,&#8221; he said, &#8220;treat the Indian like a
man who is weak; the English treat him like a dog
they despise. Both cheat him, but the Englishman
kicks him after he has robbed him, or kills him and
takes his scalp.&#8221; He declared that the traders robbed
the children of the forest, and that every frontiersman
wanted the Indians killed so as to get the land. He
had known of Indians being shot in time of peace by
trappers, who murdered them for their furs and took
their scalps and kept them so as to get bounty on them
whenever there should be war with the red men.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would kill an innocent white woman and
torture her children, in revenge for the wickedness of
the traders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Palefaces do not punish palefaces, but honour them
for the bad deeds done to the Indian, and must we
suffer alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible for us to punish these traders for
deeds we white people know nothing about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; and there was bitter scorn in the old
savage&#8217;s exclamation, &#8220;you do not open your ears.
The trader boasts and white men laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney felt there was much of truth in what the
old savage said, moreover he feared to excite him by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
further controversy, so to turn the conversation he
remarked, &#8220;You must have been with the French in
the great war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahneota brought many scalps to the French,&#8221; he
replied, proudly. &#8220;Frenchmen give us many presents
for our furs. They do not steal our land and drive
away our game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reminded of those fearful scenes during the war,
he stood erect and, pointing his long arm toward the
southeast, said, &#8220;Ahneota fought Braddock. At
Bushy Run his bullets made white men sleep, but
Colonel Bouquet was wise and fooled Indians.
Ahneota go with Pontiac, and cut off his gun so to
hide it under his blanket and go inside Fort Detroit.
He was a chief at Bloody Run. The French promise
much. They make fool of Indian and tell him Great
Father across big water had slept, but was awake and
would come and help his friends, the red men, and
bring beads and brandy and shining cloth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the Indians did right in pretending
to be friends of the English in order to kill them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think trader right when steal Indian&#8217;s furs?
Soldiers killed our women and children. They scared
away the game and we must starve. They say they
brothers of Indian; they lie. They make us old women
so to steal our land. They fool the Delawares. What
does &#8216;Little Knife&#8217; say when they kill good Indians at
Conestoga and make dogs of Moravians? Ahneota
declares paleface and Indian can never live together.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>The hatred displayed in the face of the old savage
was unmistakable, yet the boy did not fear
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have seen Colonel Washington in the
Braddock campaign?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen him. The Great Spirit keeps him
and turns the bullets away from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is much respected in Virginia. He inherited
a big estate, Mount Vernon, with much land and many
slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like all palefaces he wants more. He sends men
into the Indian country to take more land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian does not use the land as do the English.
The Indians want to roam and hunt over it. The
white man works hard and builds a home and lives on
much less land than does the Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He scares away the game and the squaw and
pappoose must cry in hunger. The Great Spirit made
this country for Indian and he must hold it or follow
the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney did not know but that he had said too much,
yet he liked a good argument and was curious to learn
how the Indians felt and what they believed. &#8220;Do
the Indians want to dig up the tomahawk and make
war on the whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The young braves do, but Ahneota fought with
Pontiac. No chief was ever obeyed by so many
Indians, by Ottawas, Wyandottes, Pottawattomies, by
the Ojibwas of the far north, all took the war belt and
made their faces black. Some day another great chief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
will bring the war belt and the red men will follow
where he may lead, but he has not come. The signs
are not right. Already the Great Father of the English
says to his children, &#8216;I have made peace with much
wampum with the Father of the French. Give me
wampum.&#8217; The children grow angry; they kick away
the peace belt and will not smoke the pipe. Then the
Indian will rise from the ground like the leaves in a
big wind and blow in their faces. When father and
children quarrel, the eagle comes down like fire from
the sky, and the wolves howl in the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy sat looking into the wild face of the savage
and shuddered. He knew the Indian hated and waited,
and, when the storm burst, he would be like a wild
beast.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the bitter hostility displayed by
the old man, his counsel was for peace and it was
evident he feared a conflict would be precipitated before
the Indians could be ready. He scowled at all reports
of disturbance. The capture of Rodney worried him.
Whenever the subject was mentioned he would say:
&#8220;Shawnees. The spirit of evil is upon the red man
and the paleface.&#8221;</p>
<p>One day the chief asked the boy if he knew Daniel
Morgan, who lived at Winchester, and from the Indian&#8217;s
manner of speaking it appeared he had great
respect for the man&#8217;s fighting qualities. He told of an
attempt to ambush Morgan, in which he took part.
They shot him, the bullet entering the mouth and coming
out on the left side, taking the teeth along with it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
Morgan was on horseback. He reeled in the saddle
but clung to the horse&#8217;s mane and urged him forward.
Ahneota ran after him, thinking to seize the horse, as
he was a swift runner. Failing in this, he threw his
tomahawk. He failed to hit Morgan, though his skill
at throwing the hatchet was great. He declared the
evil spirit turned the tomahawk aside that Morgan
might live and persecute the Indians. After the war,
such was his curiosity, he visited Winchester to learn
more about Morgan, and told the boy many things,
which the latter was to recall.</p>
<p>A few days later Fran&ccedil;ois, who had brought
&#8220;Maman&#8221; and Louis to the village, came back to buy
furs, offering in exchange blankets, knives and
hatchets, powder and ball, also he had several bottles
of brandy. The &#8220;fire-water&#8221; was, of course, the
most attractive of his wares and by afternoon several
Indians were drunk, among them Ahneota. When
Rodney learned this his heart sank, for his old friend
was helpless to protect him. He looked for
Caughnega and noticed that he was sober. That fact
indicated he intended mischief. Unless an Indian
had a very strong purpose in mind, he would not refuse
liquor. Later, Caughnega and Marie were seen talking
together, and then the trader joined them. Rodney
was walking past, and when near them Caughnega
noticed him and made a signal to the others and they
lowered their voices. Out in front of the village the
young braves had built a fire, and were dancing around
it and yelling like fiends.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do they intend to burn me?&#8221; was the question
which arose in the boy&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll die trying rather than waiting,&#8221; said the boy
to himself. He hastened to his wigwam, and taking
some dried meat and parched corn, arming himself
with knife and hatchet, also bow and arrows, he stole
unobserved out of the village and into the woods.</p>
<p>Most Indians of that day had become unaccustomed
to the use of bow and arrow, and were dependent on
the whites to furnish them with guns and ammunition.
This was a fact which the old chief bemoaned.
Rodney, being deprived of the use of a rifle, shrewdly
induced the old Indian to show him how to make a bow
and arrows and how to use them and he already had
acquired considerable skill.</p>
<p>A little distance away in the forest stood a large
tree with a hollow trunk, inside which a tall man might
stand up straight, though the opening was small. Once
he and Louis had made a sort of perch in the upper
part to which a boy might crawl and be safe from
observation, unless one went to the trouble of crawling
into the hollow and looking up.</p>
<p>Rodney made his way to the tree as best he might
in the gathering dusk and hid himself on the perch.
There he remained throughout the night, with dismal
thoughts for companions and the cries of the night
hawk to cheer him. Toward morning he fell asleep.
He was awakened by a slight noise and, looking down,
saw the face of Caughnega peering in!</p>
<p>Fortunately for both, the savage did not see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
perch and went away. Later, Rodney, cramped and
sore, crept out in quest of a drink of water. On his
return a sound inside attracted his notice and listening,
he heard sobbing. It was Louis. With a cry of joy
the little fellow threw himself into Rodney&#8217;s arms, saying,
&#8220;I thought you had run away. Caughnega said
you had. He was hunting for you last night, and this
morning I told him about this place but he came back
and said you were not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever tell him where I am when he&#8217;s
hunting for me. He hates me and would like to kill
me. But how came you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maman was cross like a bear and Fran&ccedil;ois
whipped me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she let him do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Non, but she was so cross I wouldn&#8217;t tell her.
Fran&ccedil;ois was tipsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The drunken dog! I&#8217;d like to horsewhip him.
Well, you run back, and when Ahneota is sober tell
him I&#8217;ve not run away but will come back when the
carousal is ended. Don&#8217;t say anything to any one else
about me. If Fran&ccedil;ois beats you again tell Maman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis turned back toward the village and, at a turn
in the path, met the tipsy Fran&ccedil;ois. Rodney saw the
meeting, and concealed himself behind a tree.</p>
<p>The voyageur had no arms other than the knife in
his belt. When he saw Louis he cried, &#8220;<i>H&eacute; bien!
Tiens! prends cela</i>,&#8221; slapping the little fellow&#8217;s face
and knocking him down.</p>
<p>Seeing this Rodney was infuriated and forgot all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
caution. In a few bounds he reached the voyageur
and, as the latter turned, hit him a stinging blow on the
nose, following it with a well directed one on the
Frenchman&#8217;s chin. The fellow went down like a log
and Rodney on top of him. He rolled the dazed man
on to his face and bound his arms behind his back
with a leather thong he carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you if you ever strike Louis again. You
get back to the village and, if you want to live, you
behave yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois was a sorry sight with the blood streaming
from his nose. He was sobered and scared but
he was to have revenge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>FATHER MOURNING FOR SON</h3>
</div>
<p>What of David Allison&#8217;s fortunes? Weeks
had lengthened into months and no word
had come back to Charlottesville from the
man whom the great woods had swallowed.</p>
<p>After several weeks of weary travel, through forest
and by river, the party had reached the location they
sought. It was one that would attract even the most
practical and stolid of frontiersmen: a plain of several
hundred acres surrounded by the forest, a detached
part of those great plains farther west, which stretched
hundreds of miles with scarcely a tree to dot the
expanse.</p>
<p>Along each of two sides of the plain a small stream
ran, the two uniting in quite a respectable little river
that joined the Great Kanawha River a few miles
distant. Through the tall grass of this little prairie
were great &#8220;traces&#8221; or paths beaten by the feet of
passing buffalo, elk and deer. Fish swam in the
streams and the wild turkey&#8217;s call was heard in the
forest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The Garden of Eden with a redskin for sarpint,&#8221;
was the remark of weather-beaten Dick Saunders,
when first he looked upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do him no ill an&#8217; consider weel before taking
his advice aboot forbidden fruit,&#8221; replied David
Allison.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the little prairie, near the
forest, a stockade was built of big logs, sharpened at
both ends and set close together in the ground, enclosing
about an acre in the form of a rectangle, on
one side of which, and forming part of the stockade,
were several cabins.</p>
<p>The work of construction was arduous and occupied
the greater part of the summer but when completed it
afforded a wall of protection, and a place where,
another year, such cattle as they might be able to drive
over the mountains could be sheltered from Indians.</p>
<p>As yet no sign of the red men had been found.
While this country was part of the neutral ground
between the savages of the North and those of the
South, a territory over which all hunted, yet through
it warlike bands frequently passed on their expeditions,
for there was a chronic state of hostility between these
savages.</p>
<p>The new settlers planted a little corn, but for other
food relied upon hunting. Late in the fall all but three,
of whom David Allison was one, left for home, planning
to return in the spring with their families. Clark
had not remained with the settlers as he had other
ventures. Mr. Allison sent a letter to his wife by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
only one of those returning, who lived in Charlottesville;
but he, being taken sick on the way, did not reach
home till the following spring, after Rodney had
started to join his father.</p>
<p>The winter months passed slowly for David Allison.
Most of his companions were uneducated men, accustomed,
as he was not, to the rough life. They respected
him and he did his share of the work uncomplainingly,
though an older man than the others.</p>
<p>One bitter day an Indian called. As there had been
no alarm, the entrance to the stockade had carelessly
been left open and he readily gained admittance. It
appeared he had been with a hunting party, but became
separated from them and was nearly famished. He
was given something to eat and was then told to go
along about his business. In those days some Indians
would hang around a settlement, living off the bounty
of the inhabitants, and these men didn&#8217;t intend to
encourage the habit. A storm threatened and the
Indian was loath to leave. Mr. Allison took him to
his cabin and kept him until after the storm was
past.</p>
<p>This act did not please the others of the party and
one of them remarked, &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll find that handlin&#8217; lazy,
sneakin&#8217; redskins is different from teachin&#8217; school
boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m of the opinion there&#8217;s human nature i&#8217; the
whole o&#8217; them,&#8221; was the quiet reply.</p>
<p>The three men got along without unpleasantness
until spring. One day in March Peter Cogan went out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
to hunt and did not return. Later he was found dead
and scalped.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life the horror of Indian
treachery in time of peace was forced upon Mr.
Allison&#8217;s mind. He had fought them and knew of their
cruelty in time of war, but he had never lived on the
frontier and had supposed the stories of outrages somewhat
exaggerated and due to ill treatment. His views
had been similar to those held by the Quakers of Pennsylvania.
Surely this fiendish deed was unprovoked.
With but two left, there was need of the utmost
caution and neither of the men ventured far from the
stockade.</p>
<p>One evening in May several guns were discharged
in succession outside the enclosure. The first party
from Virginia had arrived and the warmth of their
welcome may be better imagined than described.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of home?&#8221; were the first words.</p>
<p>&#8220;All well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought to see the lad along wi&#8217; you,&#8221; said
Mr. Allison.</p>
<p>Then was told the story of the attack on the Ohio,
when one man had been killed and Rodney had disappeared,
whether killed or captured was not known.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you left, deserted him!&#8221; he cried, and his cry
sounded like a scream. &#8220;Cowards each one o&#8217; ye!
Who&#8217;ll go with me to find the laddie? Not one?
Then I&#8217;ll go alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was with difficulty that he was restrained, and
finally convinced of the folly of such an undertaking.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You have a wife an&#8217; child at home yet to care for,&#8221;
said one, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;s not yer duty to throw yer life away,&#8221;
and the wisdom of this prevailed with him. But he
was never the same man again. The stoop came back
to his shoulders never to leave them. He said little
and worked unceasingly, as though in that way to
forget. On his first opportunity he turned his
face toward Virginia, resolved never to bring his
wife and little girl into the perils of the wilderness.
The journey back to Charlottesville was uneventful.
Nearly as many weeks were required for the
making of it, as hours in this age of swift transportation.</p>
<p>How he dreaded breaking the news to his wife! She
was always so patient with his many failures. Yet,
the courage displayed by Mrs. Allison at the setting
out of husband and son was such as to leave no doubt
she would meet the new ordeal bravely, as indeed she
did. From the first, she expressed great hope that the
boy had been made a captive and in time would be
restored to them, and so strongly did she urge this view
of the matter that her husband regained a little hope.
In his heart, however, there was a bitterness he could
not overcome and, as rumours of Indian outbreaks
were more frequent, he became uneasy. When, the following
spring, General Andrew Lewis was ordered by
Governor Dunmore to lead an expedition down the
Kanawha River, and across the Ohio River to the
Shawnee towns, David Allison resolved to go. The
men of the party from which Rodney was captured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
declared that their assailants were Shawnees and this
induced him to enlist under Lewis.</p>
<p>The mortgage on the little place was as yet unpaid.
Mr. Allison on his return had reopened his school, but
the pupils were few. He went to Denham, told him
of his desire to join the expedition against the Shawnees
and his reasons, and asked him if he would not
allow him longer time on the payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the time you want, Meester Allison, all the time
you want,&#8221; and he smiled his greasy smile!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>IN THE MIDST OF INCREASING PERILS</h3>
</div>
<p>Rodney did not dare to follow Fran&ccedil;ois back
to the village, nor did he think it wise to
return to the tree. Being thirsty, he risked
a visit to the spring, waiting till the dusk deepened
and the last squaw had filled her kettles or the deerskin
bottles in which they carried water. Having
drank, he concluded he would pass the night on a little
dry knoll near the spring, and from which he could
observe what was happening in the village.</p>
<p>As he lay looking out upon the bluff, whereon sat
the village, and down on the broad meadow, he
admired the location with the eye of a young pioneer.
What a delightful spot for a plantation! His boyish
imagination pictured a home like &#8220;The Hall&#8221; on the
bluff overlooking the creek. Back of that he would
have the negro cabins and the stables, for he would
have fine horses like Nat. With such a home he would
be as important a man as Squire Danesford and his
father need be under obligations to no man. Had
Lisbeth married her cousin and gone to England?
And so day dreams drifted into those of sleep.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>The next morning he returned to Ahneota and told
him what had occurred. The old chief seemed contrite
after his debauch, but did not mention it. As Rodney
left him he said: &#8220;Better be Ahneota&#8217;s brother,&#8221; but
the boy shook his head, saying: &#8220;You know why I
cannot be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois had left the village. Caughnega did not
look at the boy as they met. That evening Conrad
came and, much to the boy&#8217;s surprise, suggested that
they go fishing in the morning. Rodney readily
agreed and the following morning they went up the
creek several miles to a place where the stream broadened
out into a small pond. Its shores were lined with
lily pads under which the pickerel lay in wait for their
prey, motionless as sticks, which they resemble.</p>
<p>Rodney, who had fished there, led the way to the
mouth of a little inlet, where a tree had fallen into the
water. He had cleared away the rotten limbs so that
he might go far out on the trunk and be able to cast
the bait at a specially inviting spot. Wishing to be
friends, he offered Conrad the place at the farther end
and also the loan of his better fishing gear. Conrad,
who was very glum, hesitated, but finally accepted the
offer.</p>
<p>Now, there is luck as well as skill in fishing, as every
one knows who has tried it. Again and again they
would both cast their minnow bait, which was exactly
similar, and Rodney&#8217;s would be the hook that was
seized. Once, while the latter was baiting his hook, a
huge pickerel, darting like a flash of light, took Conrad&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
and he, being too eager, yanked vigorously before
the fish had taken the bait far enough into the mouth
to be securely hooked. Rodney immediately skipped
his bait over the place and the fish, taking that, was
skilfully landed. He was a beauty. The look of
hatred in Conrad&#8217;s face startled his companion but he
soon forgot it in the sport he was having. Tired at
last, he said: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to the village, Conrad.
We&#8217;ve got enough for one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yah! You back go vith basket full an&#8217; show Louis
an&#8217; ol&#8217; chief vat a smart brave you be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney made no reply, but turned and carefully
picked his way over the slippery trunk toward the
shore. While doing this a thought of the look of
hatred in his companion&#8217;s face prompted him to turn
his head.</p>
<p>Close behind him, with his hatchet uplifted in the
act of striking, was Conrad!</p>
<p>Rodney thrust his pole backward as one would
thrust a spear and the butt hit the other boy full in
the chest, knocking him off the slippery log into the
water.</p>
<p>Squirming and spluttering, he tried to regain his
feet but, instead, sank deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>He had fallen into a quagmire!</p>
<p>By the time Rodney had recovered his self-possession
Conrad had sunk to his chin. The delay of
another minute and he would have disappeared from
this story.</p>
<p>Rodney ran back and reached out his pole. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
other seized it and was pulled to safety, covered with
mud.</p>
<p>The boys stood looking at each other. Conrad said
nothing, but looked more sullen than ever, though his
blazing wrath was well extinguished. Finally Rodney
spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you try to kill me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Och! me, I hate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, you a paleface.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the reason. So are you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nein</i>, me, I a Wyandotte brave; ain&#8217;t so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never wronged you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louis my brother vas und you come. You tell him
Conrad not goot brother, alretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s false. I never said a word against you.
Some one has been lying to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maman heard you, yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She heard nothing of the kind. She wants me
killed for some reason, and is trying to have you
murder me, kill me from behind like a coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Red man&#8217;s vay for me goot enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not good enough for me. &#8217;Twould have
been an Indian&#8217;s way, I suppose, to have let you go
down out of sight in the mud. If I&#8217;d had the slightest
enmity to you that would have been my chance after
you tried to murder me, you blockhead! I&#8217;ve a good
mind to give you a thrashing. Maman and Caughnega
have been making a catspaw of you to do their
dirty work. If you had a spoonful of sense you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
know, now anyway, that I have nothing against you.
If you are jealous of me, help me to go back to Virginia
out of the way. Don&#8217;t try to strike me down from
behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conrad hung his head. He had not lost his sense of
shame altogether, and, noticing his embarrassment,
Rodney, prompted by an impulse he could not have
explained, held out his hand, saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s shake
hands and be friends, to each other and to Louis. He&#8217;ll
need us both.&#8221; Conrad met the offer and they returned
to the village, no word being spoken on the
way.</p>
<p>About a week later Conrad came to his wigwam and
said, &#8220;Go to Ahneota&#8217;s lodge. Fran&ccedil;ois has a Shawnee
brought, vat say you to heem belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was startling news indeed; Fran&ccedil;ois&#8217;s revenge!</p>
<p>Rodney lost no time in reporting to the chief, who
remarked, &#8220;They have been long in coming,&#8221; from
which it appeared he had expected them.</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois, bustling and important, announced a messenger
from &#8220;our brothers, the Shawnees, who has
come for this paleface, a runaway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him enter,&#8221; replied Ahneota, with dignity.</p>
<p>A villainous looking fellow, accompanied by Caughnega,
entered the lodge. Rodney did not recognize
him, which was not strange; indeed, he may not have
been one of the party that captured the boy.</p>
<p>Having entered, he made formal demand for the
return of the captive. To this Ahneota replied: &#8220;Our
people are at peace with the paleface. They have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
wronged us, but we wait. Leaves do not fall until the
tenth moon. The hatchet is buried. The paleface sits
by our fires and smokes the pipe of peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this the Shawnee responded: &#8220;I have come for
my prisoner. Our brother would not warm at the fire
of the Wyandotte the snake from the lodge of the
Shawnee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you, my brother, come from the mighty Cornstalk,
wise in counsel and fierce in war?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Shawnee hesitated, and Ahneota continued:
&#8220;Has he declared war on the paleface?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Shawnee drew himself up, he was tall and
strong, and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;If Shawnee meet Wyandotte bringing venison to
his lodge does he ask him where he got it and take it
from him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If my brother kill the paleface and bring war on
the tribes when there is peace, shall my lodge be burned
by the braves of the paleface? No, my brother. Go
back to Cornstalk and say Ahneota would sit in council
with him before the hatchet is dug up,&#8221; saying which
the old chief signified that the talk was at an end and
the Shawnee withdrew discomfited.</p>
<p>When Rodney learned what the old chief had done
in his behalf his heart warmed in gratitude toward the
old savage. At first opportunity he thanked him, but
the Indian made no reply. Caughnega soon after left
the village and did not return before the village was
moved that fall farther north, where the hunting was
said to be better.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>One day Louis came to him, crying, to bid him
good-bye as Maman was to take him to the river, which
he supposed meant back to his former home. She had
told him he was to see Father Arbeille again and was
to be taught how to be a wise boy. Louis did not want
to go, and Rodney feared ill for the little fellow.
There was nothing he could do, however. He did
speak to Ahneota about it, and said he thought she had
stolen the boy and intended no good toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She would be like bear for cub, she would die for
him. Would Little Knife do as much?&#8221;</p>
<p>This name the savage had lately given the boy.
The Indians termed the Virginians &#8220;Long Knives,&#8221;
hence the name, &#8220;Little Knife,&#8221; applied to the lad.</p>
<p>That winter several of the men relied upon for
hunting visited a distant tribe, and meat grew scarce.
Since the departure of Caughnega and Maman, Rodney
went about more freely and the old chief loaned
his rifle and allowed him to hunt. He and Conrad
made several excursions together. On one of these
trips they set out with but little food and wandered for
several days, nearly starved and half frozen. On the
third day Conrad, discovering a hole half way up the
trunk of a big tree, stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vat you tink?&#8221; asked Rodney, mimicking his companion&#8217;s
speech, for now they were excellent friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tink dat one goot hole for bear, ain&#8217;t so?&#8221; was
the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You suppose an old fellow has a nest in there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tink some look in be goot.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>They cut down a sapling standing near, &#8220;lodging&#8221;
it against the big tree. Then they built a fire and,
collecting the tips of green boughs and long grass
damp with frost, tied them into a bundle at the end of
a pole. While Conrad &#8220;shinned&#8221; up the sapling till
the pole would reach the hole, Rodney lighted the
bundle which smoked like a &#8220;smudge.&#8221; Conrad
thrust the smoking bundle into the hole and, a minute
later, a wheezing sound was heard. Bruin was there
and was waking from his winter sleep!</p>
<p>Rodney seized the rifle while Conrad slid to the
ground. But the bear looked out and made no effort
to descend.</p>
<p>Conrad then relighted the torch and climbed up far
enough to thrust it in the bear&#8217;s face. This angered
him and he began to back down the tree.</p>
<p>Unlike Rodney&#8217;s first encounter with a bear, the lad
now had ample time for taking steady aim and the
brute fell mortally wounded.</p>
<p>How delicious the meal, which followed, tasted after
their long fast!</p>
<p>Taking as much of the choicest cuts as they could
carry, they returned to the encampment to find the
Indians in a famished condition. Ahneota for the two
previous days had given his allowance of food to the
children.</p>
<p>The winter, what with hunting and trapping, passed
quickly. The wild, free life with all its hardships and
annoyances appealed to Rodney, and he came to understand
how children taken captives by the Indians, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
later returned to their parents, would occasionally run
away and rejoin the red folk. His home ties were too
strong, however, for him to entertain such a thought,
and he lay awake many nights wondering how he
might make his escape.</p>
<p>The severity of the winter had greatly weakened
Ahneota. The skin was drawn over his cheekbones
like parchment. He was so lame with rheumatism that
he needed constant care and the boy served him in
many ways.</p>
<p>The hunters, though few in number, had gathered a
fine lot of furs, and, when the ice was breaking up in
the streams, the sugar maples were tapped. Their
implements for this purpose were crude. Their method
consisted in cutting a gash through the bark with a
tomahawk and into this driving a chip which served
as a &#8220;spile&#8221; to conduct the dripping sap into the dishes
of elm bark, from which it was taken and boiled into
sugar. This sugar was often mixed with bear&#8217;s fat and
stored in sacks made of skins, a mixture much prized
by the Indians.</p>
<p>A little later the tribe returned to the bluff where
Rodney was first introduced to its life, there to plant
the corn and tobacco.</p>
<p>Rumours of trouble with the whites increased. The
latter part of May Fran&ccedil;ois returned, but without
Maman and Louis, and he brought, to trade for the
valuable furs, rifles and ammunition and brandy, and
waxed rich, while the savages with their new implements
of war became more restless.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE BEGINNING OF WAR</h3>
</div>
<p>From the history of those days one learns that
there were white savages who compared unfavourably
with the red ones.</p>
<p>Of such were those border ruffians who, tempting
the family of a friendly Indian with liquor till they
were stupefied with drink, murdered them.</p>
<p>The Indian chief returned to find them weltering in
blood. He was an Iroquois who had moved his family
from New York to the Ohio River.</p>
<p>His Indian name was Tahgahjute, but he was commonly
called Logan from the fact that he had in early
life lived with a white family of that name. Ever after
he had been a staunch friend of the whites. Now he
became almost insane in his natural anger, and went
about among the various tribes calling on them to
avenge his wrongs.</p>
<p>Had those border ruffians desired to bring on an
Indian war they could not have so quickly done it in
any other way. Soon, tales of pioneer families murdered
by the Indians were brought over the mountains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
into Virginia. Logan&#8217;s friends were seeking
vengeance.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the war would have broken out later
had not Logan&#8217;s family been murdered. The Indians
believed they must fight or be overrun by the white
immigrants pouring into the western country.</p>
<p>The royal governor appointed by the king over the
colony of Virginia was, at this time, Lord Dunmore.
He was an ardent loyalist, but he also is said to have
been interested financially in some of the land ventures,
concerning which there was much interest in the
colony, also much speculation. Though Governor
Dunmore knew that the policy of the English ministry
at the time was conciliatory, he did not hesitate to prepare
for a war which should bring the savages to
submission.</p>
<p>Just why the English ministry tried to discourage
immigration into the western country is not definitely
known. Doubtless there were various reasons. England
wanted peace with the savages. Only a few years
before, her representative, Sir William Johnson, had
made a treaty at Fort Stanwix with them and given
them many presents. They had been told they should
have, as their own, the country north of the Ohio. The
laws which governed the province of Quebec, recently
captured from the French, were to be applied to the
western country, a plan which did not meet with the
approval of the colonists who wanted laws of an
English character.</p>
<p>There were influential men in England who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
interested in the fur trade with the Indians, which
would be seriously injured if the country were opened
up to settlers. Besides, the colonies of Virginia and
Pennsylvania made conflicting claims to the new land
and each had friends in England.</p>
<p>Many of the colonists declared that England feared
to have the powerful colonies increase in power with
new territory, and wished to confine them to the seaboard.
Be that as it may, Dunmore resolved on establishing
Virginia&#8217;s claims by prompt and effectual warfare.
Perhaps he thought to divert the colonists&#8217;
minds from the increasing hostility to England. Instead
he was to take the first step toward securing that
rich land to the United States of America.</p>
<p>This is but one of many instances when the plans of
supposed wise men result in the opposite to that
intended.</p>
<p>The assembling for this war might be likened to a
swarming of bees and hornets, the one for the sweets
of fertile lands and adventure, the other for vengeance
on account of wrongs received at the hands of the
Indians.</p>
<p>There came a British officer, pompous and resplendent
in scarlet and gold; the British soldier for his
first experience in border warfare; the trapper with his
long rifle and frontier garb; the sturdy settler in homespun.
Nor were the camp followers altogether absent,
those who hang about for pickings and have little
intention of fighting.</p>
<p>One heard the polite accent of culture, the soft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
spoken Southerner, the dialects of Scotch and Irish and
the gutturals of the German. About them were the
green woods and filtering through the leaves overhead
the hot sunshine of summer.</p>
<p>Early in the season that already famous frontiersman,
Daniel Boone, had been sent to the Falls of the
Ohio to lead back to the settlements a party of surveyors.
He did it, for in the ways of the wilderness no
savage was his equal.</p>
<p>Governor Dunmore, on July 12, 1774, ordered General
Andrew Lewis, who twenty years before had been
with Washington at Fort Necessity, to raise four
regiments of volunteers and, going down the Great
Kanawha River, to cross the Ohio River and march
against the Shawnees on the Scioto. In this expedition
was David Allison.</p>
<p>Another expedition was to meet near Wheeling to
assist General Lewis. For this purpose Major Angus
McDonald marched seven hundred militia and frontiersmen
over the mountains in the latter part of June.
Daniel Morgan assisted in raising a part of this little
army from among his neighbours and acquaintances,
which were many, for he had served in the two previous
wars with French and Indians and was a natural
leader of men.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of George Rogers Clark, none
other than &#8220;Cap&#8217;n&#8221; Clark who had induced David
Allison to try his fortunes on the Kanawha, Fort
Fincastle was built. In the latter part of July these
troops moved down the Ohio River to Fish Creek and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
started on a raid against the Indian villages on the
Muskingum River, which is fed by the creeks that flow
through the country where Rodney Allison had been
passing his months of captivity, one of them the creek
overlooking which stood the lodge of Ahneota.</p>
<p>Of this motley army some were in canoes, some in
pirogues and others in batteaux. In a large canoe,
third back from the prow, sat a fine-looking man, distinguishable
from his associates in more ways than
may be easily described. His clothes were such as one
would see on the well-dressed man about the streets of
Philadelphia; his companions were in the garb of the
frontier. He was broad of shoulder with erect, military
figure; while they were lithe and sinewy. His
features bore marks of good breeding and his voice
and language were those of a man of the world.</p>
<p>His companions had discovered that he knew nothing
of woodcraft, but much of military matters. Just
where Morgan found him or he Morgan does not yet
appear. On the day the militia assembled Ezekiel
Holden of Boston had given him a name. Ezekiel was
a character, Yankee to the backbone. He had found
his way to Norfolk on a coasting vessel a few months
before and was &#8220;lookin&#8217; araoun a leetle.&#8221; &#8220;Zeke&#8221;
was fond of argument and delighted in arguing with
Virginians about what he considered the superiority of
New Englanders. He was for liberty and &#8220;pop&#8217;lar
rights,&#8221; &#8220;first, last an&#8217; all the time,&#8221; and the rich
Virginians he looked upon as part of the English
aristocracy, descendants of those who had fought for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
King Charles, while &#8220;Zeke&#8221; wished it understood his
forebears fought under Cromwell.</p>
<p>When he saw this man he was in the midst of his pet
argument and exclaimed: &#8220;There&#8217;s one o&#8217; them chevaliers
naow,&#8221; meaning cavalier, but pronouncing it
&#8220;Shiverleer.&#8221; From that moment the rather distinguished
looking recruit was known among his fellows
as &#8220;Chevalier,&#8221; and in truth the name fitted his manner
excellently. Furthermore he appeared to like the
nickname and to take delight in letting his companions
know that he considered himself their superior, though,
be it said, this was in a spirit of humour rather than of
conceit, and he was ready to share toil or rations with
his mates. Yet this air did not please them and there
was consequently much chaffing.</p>
<p>The afternoon was hot and the men tired, just the
moment when a little inspiration was needed. One of
the men said to his fellow in the prow of the canoe,
&#8220;Nick, ah reckon it&#8217;s about time fer you to lead off
with a tune, one we kin hit the paddles to,&#8221; and this
was Nick&#8217;s response:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;The only good Injun, he died long ago.<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Shove her along, boy, shove her along.<br />

<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Push her along, boy, push her along.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, my worthy companion in toil. Verily thou
makest the bending ash to glide through the water like
a swan&#8217;s wing. Another verse and we bid adieu to
work.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If it affects the Chevalier that ar way, better give
him another, Nick,&#8221; said one of the men.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;The trees do grow tall where the corn ought to grow,<br />

<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Shove her along, boys, shove her along.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;I would applaud, but my paddle is now going of
itself and I dare not let go. Methinks we&#8217;ll find around
the next bend Pan with his flocks of aborigines assembled
and kneeling in adoration. I&#8217;m not sure but
he&#8217;ll have the moon goddess with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the Chevalier&#8217;s three companions knew nothing
of Pan or the moon goddess, with the possible exception
of Nick, whose knowledge of mythology, if he
possessed it, had not as yet appeared. Not knowing,
they resented this intrusion of classical subjects and
one remarked, &#8220;Your talk has a sweet sound; &#8217;sposin&#8217;
you sing us a verse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, melody is a wayward minx and vouchsafes her
treasures of song to few. Were it springtime and had
I the gift I would sing:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;&#8216;When the red is on the maple and the dogwood is in bloom.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Keep right on, you&#8217;ll bloom right soon,&#8221; said Nick
with a laugh in which all joined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep her goin&#8217;, Chevalier,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forsooth, my merry men, Puritans, Roundheads,
I&#8217;ll try:</p>

The pikes may gleam in thousands strong,<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Sure they stood not on the order o&#8217; goin&#8217;, or I&#8217;ve
misread me history,&#8221; laughed Nick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho! my merry figure-head at the prow, this
from you, <i>et tu Brute</i>! I feared the lines would not
scan, but it&#8217;s not expected that every man in the crew
must be an Adonis because the figure-head of the craft
is a thing of beauty. One failure begets another, &#8217;tis
said, so perhaps you&#8217;ll like this no better:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Ah! but that&#8217;s worse than the first. I yield the
palm of song to him who goes before me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This bantering was interrupted by a stalwart man
sitting in the prow of a canoe which overtook them at
this point. He was as fine a specimen of rugged manhood
as all the border could produce, being over six
feet in height, of commanding figure and boundless
energy and courage. He was Daniel Morgan and,
laughing as he spoke, he said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of hunting
Indians with fife and drum, but charmin&#8217; &#8217;em with song
is something new, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>HORNETS WITH AND WITHOUT WINGS</h3>
</div>
<p>During Fran&ccedil;ois&#8217;s visit a runner came in with
the report that two Indians, descending the
Ohio River in a canoe, had been fired upon
and killed by the whites. Inflamed by the brandy they
had drank, and infuriated by the report, several of the
younger men blacked their faces, set up a war post and
danced around it in the firelight like demons, yelling
and throwing their hatchets into the post. The following
morning a party of them set out for revenge.</p>
<p>On such occasions Rodney kept in hiding as much
as possible and his mind was dark with forebodings, so
that he would wake in the night from dreams of torture
and find himself wet with perspiration.</p>
<p>A little later Logan himself came to the village,
pleading that the Indians dig up the hatchet and unite
in a war of revenge upon the whites for the outrage
committed against him. He was a distinguished looking
Indian, straight and tall, a typical chieftain of the
better sort. Ahneota pleaded the necessity of delay,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
but, that being of no avail, urged him to secure the
services of Cornstalk, the wise and wily Shawnee
chief.</p>
<p>Rodney sympathized with the Indians until a
returning party brought back scalps torn from the
heads of women and children as well as from men, and
then his heart sickened and he looked on them with
trembling to see if among them he could discover that
of his father.</p>
<p>Having no rifle, the boy armed himself with the
bow, this being his only defence in case of attack,
though he knew it would be of little use against
savages armed with rifles. One day, in the latter part
of July, he was strolling through the forest not far
from the village when he heard voices.</p>
<p>During his captivity Rodney had learned to stalk
game and this training he now put to use. Stealthily
approaching, he saw a group of strange Indians, and
with them Caughnega. The latter had set up, in a
little opening among the trees, his wigwam of skins, in
which he was accustomed to perform certain of the
rites of a &#8220;medicine man.&#8221; The boy knew that Caughnega&#8217;s
fame was not confined to the local tribes, and at
once concluded these Indians had come to consult him,
probably as to what the spirits, good and evil, might
have to say respecting the approaching war.</p>
<p>Evidently Caughnega had begun his work, for he
was now ready to enter his wigwam. Silence came
upon the group waiting patiently outside. After quite
a long wait a medley of sounds issued from the interior
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
of the wigwam in which Caughnega was shut and the
structure itself rocked as if in a gale. Knowing that
Indians can mimic the sounds of all animals and birds
with which they are acquainted, the boy had no doubt
these sounds were made by Caughnega himself. If so,
he was certainly an artist, and the assembled group
sat around awestruck, for they had no doubt the noises
were made by the spirits.</p>
<p>After the disturbance subsided, Caughnega came out
and, standing before them, addressed them, telling
what, he said, the spirits had told him. The message
incited the savages to great ardour, which they
manifested by brandishing their tomahawks and yelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is the work that villain is doing unknown
to Ahneota,&#8221; thought Rodney. Just then he espied
a large nest of hornets suspended to a limb overhanging
the group. He recognized the nest as that of a
variety of hornet which is large and valiant. The
spirit of mischief entered the boy and, taking careful
aim, he shot an arrow, which struck and tore away
a portion of the paper nest.</p>
<p>Now a hornet does not hold a council of war when
disturbed, but instantly attacks, like an Indian, the first
object that presents itself, and in this instance Caughnega
was the first target.</p>
<p>He stood, his back toward the nest, pouring out the
words of the message in sonorous tones. Suddenly
this flow of language was punctuated by a blood-curdling
yell, as one of those winged bullets struck him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
just behind the left ear. About the same moment
others in the group were hit. Yells and back somersaults
were mingled for a moment, and then those
doughty warriors fled as never from the face of a
white man.</p>
<p>Rodney lay on the ground in convulsions of silent
laughter.</p>
<p>On returning to the village the boy related his story
to the old chief, who listened gravely and at the end
said, &#8220;The Great Spirit will be angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe the &#8216;medicine man&#8217; can talk with
him?&#8221; asked Rodney, incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahneota knows the ways of the birds and the
beaver, but the ways of the spirits he does not know.
I see the medicine lodge tremble and hear voices; they
are not the voices of Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney did not dare to argue the matter, and there
was silence for a long time. In the flickering firelight
the old chief&#8217;s face was ghastly.</p>
<p>The boy fell into an unpleasant reverie. Soon
would come the moment when he must flee, for to
remain, he was sure, would mean his death. The
difficulties of escape, because of the uprising among
the Indians, had greatly increased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Between here and La Belle Riviere are many Mingoes,
Delawares and Shawnees. Little Knife cannot
fly nor leap from tree to tree like panther. He must
be brother of Ahneota.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy was startled. It seemed to him that the
Indian had been reading his thoughts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The paleface comes and Ahneota&#8217;s brother must
take his scalp. That Little Knife cannot do,&#8221; Rodney
replied.</p>
<p>Silence of many minutes followed. Rodney became
uneasy and was about to leave when the chief, taking
a stick in his trembling hand, drew it over the sand
and began to describe the country which lay between
them and the Ohio River.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before another moon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the palefaces
will come in many canoes to the Indians&#8217; country.
Little Knife will run to meet them. He will not be
the brother of the chief. He must go to his people.
He must go like the fox.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following day Ahneota called in several men of
the village and Rodney. Then, giving his rifle to the
boy, he said: &#8220;Little Knife has been brother of Ahneota,
has brought him meat when he starved. He
must have gun to bring more meat, for the chief is
old and cannot hunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indians did not look pleased, for the rifle was a
valuable one and much coveted. One said, &#8220;White
blood must be washed away,&#8221; but, as the old chief
made no reply, they went away.</p>
<p>As the boy started to leave the lodge the Indian
lifted his head and said, &#8220;When Little Knife points
the old chief&#8217;s gun at man, let him not see the colour
of skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney now began to store up, against the emergency
he knew was approaching, a stock of dried venison,
and hominy and parched corn. His experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
when surrounded by hostile savages had taught him
the difficulty of securing food on the march.</p>
<p>As he lay in the shadow of a bush one day he noticed
a little worm travelling along a twig. It was the
variety commonly called an &#8220;inch worm,&#8221; which advances
by pulling its rear up to its forward feet, its
back in a curve, and then thrusts forward its length.
As the boy watched its laborious progress he thought,
&#8220;If one may only keep going he&#8217;ll get there in time,&#8221;
and somehow he felt encouraged. Had he not thought
it his duty to remain and care for the old chief he
would have set forth that very hour.</p>
<p>As he came near the village several guns were fired
in quick succession down at the creek and he knew
a party of savages had returned from one of their
raids!</p>
<p>The inmates of the village hurried down to meet
the newcomers, but the boy lagged behind. Soon they
came running back and formed two lines. Some captive
must run the gauntlet!</p>
<p>The prisoner was a man of forty years or more.
His hair was long and matted and his arms were
bound. Evidently his captors had found him a difficult
subject with whom to deal. In running the gauntlet
he could not ward off the blows, his arms being
tied, but he delivered one well directed kick that doubled
a brave up in agony. He got through, but was
horribly beaten. All the while he was yelling at the
savages in derision, calling them old women and apparently
doing everything in his power to enrage them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>A post was set in the ground in front of the encampment,
and the prisoner was led out and tied to
it. On the way he kicked an Indian, who in his rage
would have killed him on the spot, had not another
interfered. Sudden death in preference to torture was
evidently what the captive sought, but it was not to be
granted.</p>
<p>Thinking Ahneota might prevent the torture, which
now seemed inevitable, Rodney hurried to the chief&#8217;s
lodge. Within, it was almost dark and he could but
dimly see the figure of the man seated on a bear skin,
his back against a bale of furs. His head was inclined
forward, his chin on his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahneota!&#8221; called the boy loudly in his excitement,
but there was no answer.</p>
<p>Thinking the Indian slept, the boy grasped him by
the arm to wake him.</p>
<p>Ahneota had passed to the &#8220;happy hunting
ground!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A WELCOME VOICE</h3>
</div>
<p>Dense bushes fringed a bluff looking down on
the Muskingum River. In these, concealed
from view, lay a boy of fifteen. His face was
worn and thin. His moccasins and leggins were
frayed from much running through undergrowth. He
was peering through the branches to a bend in the
river. He had lain there hours, watching. That
morning, a canoe containing two savages came up
past him. The Indians were paddling vigorously.
Why their haste? That was what the boy would know.</p>
<p>The reader has guessed the lad&#8217;s name and so will
readily understand that Rodney Allison concluded if
the Indians were being pursued it was by white men.</p>
<p>Ah! was it? Yes, surely that was the shadow of a
canoe. Now he could see its sides under the overhanging
branches which concealed its occupants from
his view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloa!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one of &#8217;em coming down through the
bushes now, Nick,&#8221; exclaimed a man in the stern of
the canoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never could sing that song without interruption,
Chevalier.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker had shipped his paddle and grasped his
rifle, saying as he did so: &#8220;Look out, boys, the voice
is white but there may be red shenannegan behind
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney Allison leaped to the beach below in full
view of the party. There he stood, panting and
staring as though at a ghost.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, sonny, if ye&#8217;ve objections to our looks now&#8217;s
the time to put &#8217;em on file,&#8221; said Nick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominick Ferguson! I thought you were dead!&#8221;
gasped the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aisy now, don&#8217;t feel so bad bekase I&#8217;m not.
Whereabout did ye find the handle o&#8217; me name, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not the man the Indians killed, that day
down on the Ohio, when they captured me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look loike I was?&#8221; Then dawning comprehension
showed in the man&#8217;s face. &#8220;Ah reckon poor
Job Armistead was the unfortnit one; he never showed
up. May your name be Allison?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is. Have you room in the canoe for one
more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make room,&#8221; spoke two of the men at the
same moment, turning the craft to shore. Thus, after
long months of captivity and days of fleeing through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
a country infested with warlike savages, Rodney Allison
came back to his own people.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have seen my father, then, Mr. Ferguson?&#8221;
said the boy as he stepped into the canoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure; found him expectin&#8217; ye an&#8217; he was nigh
crazy. You ought to heard him call us cowards an&#8217;
knaves fer leavin&#8217; ye. He wanted to start right off
alone to bring ye back, an&#8217; would, but we told him
thar were others in his family to think about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he now, and have you any news from
Charlottesville?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went back to Virginny an&#8217; give up the enterprise
down on the Kanawha. Saw a man the other
day who said he heard yer father had joined the men
under Lewis. Now if he&#8217;d come along with us we&#8217;d
had a family gatherin&#8217; right out here in the woods.
The family&#8217;s well, I reckon, or yer dad wouldn&#8217;t hev
gone sojerin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day the expedition left the river and began
a march toward an Indian settlement known as Wappatomica
Town. In the order of this march the division
under Captain Wood went ahead, much to the
disgust of some of the men with Morgan, for they
were greedy for glory, and a chance to win laurels
and the consequent promotions.</p>
<p>As they were marching through a part of the country
through which Rodney had passed in his flight, he
remarked to Ferguson, &#8220;I don&#8217;t envy the fellows on
ahead when they come to a place about a mile from
here. If I know anything about Indians, they&#8217;ll lie in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
wait for us there,&#8221; and he described a locality where
he had hidden from a party of savages, one of the
critical experiences in his flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me lad, you come with Ferguson,&#8221; and Rodney
was conducted by him to Morgan and introduced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my boy, if you got out alive we ought to be
able to get in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Morgan, from where I lay in hiding that
day a dozen men could shoot down fifty marching
below.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This lad, Captain, knows what he&#8217;s talking about.
The chief of the village where he was captive was the
redskin that shot ye through the neck and chased ye
an&#8217; threw his hatchet at yer head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ahneota said the Great Spirit turned the
tomahawk aside so that you might live to persecute
the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the old rascal was right. I think, young
man, we&#8217;ll need you for scout duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Askin&#8217; yer pardon, Captain, but the lad&#8217;s had his
share o&#8217; risk, to my thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nick, we are here to do something. Every man
must do the best he can. This boy can do that work
better than you or I. If you were the best man would
ye shirk it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go, Captain,&#8221; replied Ferguson, &#8220;but don&#8217;t
send the boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do what I can, Captain Morgan,&#8221; said
Rodney.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell &#8217;em, Ferguson, I can tell &#8217;em,&#8221; and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
look of approval Morgan gave the boy as he spoke was
one for which Rodney Allison would have stormed an
Indian town alone and single handed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, young man, you run ahead and warn Wood.
Tell him Morgan sent ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney ran forward with alacrity, proud of the
responsibility that had been placed on him. He had
not gone far before he discovered that the place of
ambush was much nearer than he had thought, an
error wholly excusable, considering the conditions under
which he had first seen the country.</p>
<p>He ran at top speed, but was too late, otherwise he
might have been among the men who fell under the
volley which a band of about fifty Indians, lying in
ambush at the very place indicated by the boy, poured
into the ranks of Captain Wood&#8217;s men.</p>
<p>Rodney hesitated and then ran forward, joining in
the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</p>
<p>A moment later there was yelling and commotion
behind, and Morgan and his men came running to
their support. A heavy hand was laid on the boy&#8217;s
shoulder, and Captain Morgan demanded of him, &#8220;Do
you know of any place where we can get behind the
red devils and dislodge &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, Captain,&#8221; and Rodney ran to the right.
He recalled the way he had left the hiding place.
Up that bluff they might attack the Indians in the
rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; Morgan shouted, and a rush was
made upon the heels of young Allison.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>A shot from above warned them that the Indians
had discovered their approach. Rodney heard the bullet
singing. The next instant Morgan seized him by
the shoulder, saying, &#8220;Go back! You are ordered to
the rear;&#8221; then, with a yell, the leader charged up
the hill, his men close at his back. The charge dislodged
the Indians and they fled.</p>
<p>The troops advanced toward the town more cautiously,
but found the Indians had deserted it, carrying
away everything movable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why ain&#8217;t we chasin&#8217; &#8217;em, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;
asked an ensign with an important air.</p>
<p>&#8220;We first better find out whether they&#8217;re running
or hiding,&#8221; replied Rodney, nettled at the fellow&#8217;s importance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensible remark,&#8221; said Captain Morgan, who had
come up and heard the conversation. &#8220;You know
something about this country, also about Indians.
Suppose you slip along behind the trees an&#8217; cross the
creek half a mile up stream and see what ye can find.
Don&#8217;t shoot unless obliged to and don&#8217;t hurry. Don&#8217;t
leave shelter until you are sure there ain&#8217;t a redskin
behind the trees in front.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a perilous task, and some might blame Morgan
for assigning the boy to it. As it has already
appeared, he would ask no one to attempt that which
he wouldn&#8217;t do himself, and the conclusion must be that
he thought the boy the best one he could send on the
duty which some one must do.</p>
<p>The boy had listened to Ahneota&#8217;s descriptions of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Indian methods in battle and knew they would have
scouts out. He believed the main body would simply
cross the stream and lie in wait for the troops and
attack them crossing so as to throw them into confusion.
They would, however, send men to reconnoitre
the main body of the troops, and these scouts,
assigned to a task similar to his, were the ones he must
avoid, a difficult thing to do, as will be readily understood.</p>
<p>Rodney made his way with extreme caution until
he caught a glimpse of an Indian stealthily advancing
toward the main body of troops; then, believing that
Indian would be the only one sent from that quarter
and having eluded the redskin, he went hastily forward
to the creek, crossing it at a narrow place fully half a
mile above where the savages had crossed.</p>
<p>Making his way down toward the ambush was
nerve-racking work, but finally the boy was rewarded
by discovering a sentinel on guard.</p>
<p>The Indians were waiting just where he had supposed.
Now to get back without meeting the scout
he had passed! At last the feat was accomplished
without a glimpse of a savage on the way. On his
arrival he found the troops getting ready to advance,
for another scout, sent out at the same time as he, had
returned with the report that he found no Indians and
that they must have fled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they are there,&#8221; exclaimed Rodney, and he
told what he had seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The youngster&#8217;s got redskins on the brain, I calc&#8217;late,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
drawled one fellow, at which the boy got very
red in the face.</p>
<p>Captain Morgan here appeared, saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re
back at last. What d&#8217;ye see?&#8221;</p>
<p>When the boy described what he had done Morgan
promptly said, &#8220;You did your duty, my boy,&#8221; and
proceeded to act on the information. A guard was
posted to make sure the savages did not recross and
make an attack, for it was found they were in considerable
force.</p>
<p>After several days, during which skirmishes were
fought and the Indians beaten, the savages sued for
peace and were asked to give hostages.</p>
<p>Rodney did not believe they wanted peace. They
had been too angry to be satisfied with no worse defeat
than this. His opinion proved correct and, the troops
being short of provisions, a retreat began, everything
belonging to the savages being first destroyed even to
the corn, of which the troops took for their own use
all they could carry. In fact, before they got back
to Wheeling, they were obliged to live on one ear
per day to each soldier, very short rations for
men marching and fighting, as the savages dogged
their footsteps and inflicted considerable losses on
them.</p>
<p>There were times on the retreat when it seemed the
troops would be cut off and annihilated. In this struggle
Rodney bore his part so well as to win the approval
of his associates. One day on the retreat, when the
boy and the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; were acting as flankers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
scouting ahead and outside the main body, Rodney
saved his companion&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; was not familiar with Indian
methods of fighting and held them in contempt. He
and the boy had several arguments about the matter,
the former contending that a savage was dangerous
only when one was running away from him.</p>
<p>In the work they were now assigned to, it was a
part of wisdom to screen one&#8217;s self behind trees, advancing
quickly from one to another.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; declared he was not out in that
country for the &#8220;fun of dodging.&#8221; Rodney, however,
adhered to the practice, luckily for both.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; was striding along as though an
enemy were not within a hundred miles, when the lad&#8217;s
trained eye caught sight of the heel of a savage, who
was kneeling behind a big tree and waiting for his foe
to pass. The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; was walking on, his head
up, and in three paces would have exposed himself to
the redskin&#8217;s rifle.</p>
<p>Rodney yelled an alarm and took a quick shot at the
Indian&#8217;s heel, the only part of him exposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump behind a tree and hold your fire,&#8221; the boy
had cried, for, if he missed the savage, he would need
the protection of the &#8220;Chevalier&#8217;s&#8221; rifle before he
could reload. But his shot went true, as a howl from
the savage bore witness.</p>
<p>Startled by the cry and the report of the rifle, the
&#8220;Chevalier,&#8221; for once, moved quickly to cover, and,
between the two, they compelled the Indian to surrender.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
He had a painful wound in his ankle and finally,
after being disarmed, was left behind, though some of
the men wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; extended his hand to Rodney,
saying, &#8220;I have you to thank for my poor existence.
You did ill trying to do well, but of course
you didn&#8217;t know it. Perhaps I will find a way to
repay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man spoke seriously, not in a spirit of banter,
and Rodney wondered. When he told one of the men
later what the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; had said, the fellow remarked:
&#8220;So the Chevalier was solemn, was he?
Kain&#8217;t be possible his mightiness is sufferin&#8217; from liver
complaint with only one ear o&#8217; corn a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>All were glad to be back at Wheeling, where Major
McDonald decided to wait for the arrival of Governor
Dunmore. The governor finally arrived in all the
pomp of war and with enough men to raise the total
number to about twelve hundred.</p>
<p>Up to the time of his arrival it had been supposed
that he would take his army down the Ohio River and
join that of General Lewis before making an attack
on the Indians. Now he announced that the army
would proceed in boats down the Ohio to the Hockhocking
River and up that river to the falls, whence he
would march across country to the Indian towns on
the Scioto River. He sent messengers to General
Lewis ordering him to join the main body at that
point.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the redskins learn what&#8217;s up they&#8217;ll have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
chance to wipe Lewis off the earth,&#8221; remarked one
frontiersman in Rodney&#8217;s hearing.</p>
<p>The Indians did learn Dunmore&#8217;s plan and almost
succeeded in defeating the division under Lewis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>RODNEY MEETS WITH REVERSES</h3>
</div>
<p>All historical accounts of the battle between the
forces under Lewis and the allied Indians commanded
by the Shawnee chief, Cornstalk,
which occurred at Point Pleasant on the Ohio River,
October 10, 1774, agree that it was the fiercest conflict
which had been fought in this country between white
men and Indians led by an Indian, unaided by the advice
of any white officer.</p>
<p>Cornstalk was a chief of unusual ability and good
sense. He had been opposed to the war, but, finding
it inevitable, succeeded in raising a formidable army
of the various tribes, and commanded them with such
skill and bravery that, in the battle, which lasted all
day, the Indians fought doggedly and all but achieved
a victory, which would have made a very different
affair of what is known as Dunmore&#8217;s war.</p>
<p>His spies had kept him informed of the movements
of the two Virginia expeditions, and he resolved to
attack them separately before they could join their
forces.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>Leaving scattering bands of Indians to delay the
advance of Dunmore, he marched his main body of
warriors to the Ohio River, crossed, and attacked the
troops under General Lewis.</p>
<p>This commander had wisely chosen a position on a
point, having the Ohio River on his left, Crooked
Creek on his right, and the Great Kanawha at his rear.
He was a veteran seasoned in the French and Indian
war. With him was the courtly John Sevier, a French
Huguenot planning for fortune in the lands of Kentucky,
James Robertson, a wise leader of pioneers, and
others of but slightly less distinction in the eyes of the
hardy men who had gathered under their leadership.</p>
<p>All day long the battle raged there among the trees
of the forest. The colonists could hear the voice of
Cornstalk as he passed from tree to tree among his
men, encouraging them. Rarely did they see more of
their foes than a coppery gleam from behind a tree
trunk, perchance the arm or leg of a savage or a
glimpse of his warlock, and it was sure death to leave
the shelter of the trees.</p>
<p>Toward night the company, with which David Allison
at the time was associated, was ordered to make
a flank movement. This was done with great difficulty
and danger. When the movement was nearly
accomplished, the men leaping from tree to tree as
they advanced, he fell with a bullet through the neck.
A brawny savage leaped from his cover, knife in hand
and greedy for a fresh scalp, when a ball from a colonist&#8217;s
gun stopped him half-way and he too went down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
in the brush by the side of his victim. Over them
leaped friend and foe without heeding.</p>
<p>Allison had fallen into a depression between two
little knolls and the savage in falling had swept the
bushes down over him so that he was covered from
view. Later the Indians succeeded in dragging away
their fallen comrade but overlooked, fortunately, the
body of the white man.</p>
<p>General Lewis and his men were eager to pursue
and thoroughly chastise the Indians. They reasoned
that, while they were about it, the only wise thing to
do was to administer such a defeat that the red people
would keep the peace for years to come.</p>
<p>They crossed the Ohio and took up their march
toward the Indian towns. When Dunmore&#8217;s messenger
arrived with orders for them to join him they were
angry. He had left them to their fate, they had won
a hard earned victory and were determined to follow
it to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p>Lord Dunmore&#8217;s force, after building a hastily constructed
fort at the mouth of the Hockhocking River
as a base for their supplies, continued to advance on
the Indian towns. The savages had met overtures for
peace with evasive replies or delays until they heard
of the defeat of Cornstalk at Point Pleasant, then they
earnestly sued for peace.</p>
<p>Cornstalk urged a continuation of the war, but in
vain. The savages had acted more determinedly under
him than ever before, but now they wished to save
their towns and crops from destruction.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>Dunmore moved forward to a place called Camp
Charlotte. Lewis pushed ahead to wreak vengeance
on the savages, not stopping until a third order had
been sent him by Dunmore commanding him to halt.</p>
<p>Lewis and his men thought this an interference with
their rights. There were many heartburnings in his
command, and rumours that Dunmore was acting
under the advice of England to put an end to the war
were generally believed.</p>
<p>Rodney obtained permission to visit the camp of
General Lewis, eager to find his father. He went
without forebodings and with a feeling of assurance
that he should find him. The Indians had been defeated.
The command had won a glorious victory,
and, as is usually the case, while exulting over it, he
overlooked the sacrifices made and hardships endured.
He did not realize that General Lewis had lost half his
commissioned officers and between fifty and sixty of
his men. When told that his father, the man he loved
above all others, was missing and undoubtedly had
fallen in the battle, the blow was terribly hard to bear.
He had known nothing like it, and made his way back
to his quarters as one walking in his sleep. There,
Morgan chanced to find him, his head bowed in his
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homesick, my lad, or a fit o&#8217; the blues?&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan had a voice that sounded in battle like the
roar of a lion, but in it, as he spoke to Rodney, was
a tone of genuine sympathy and the boy broke down
and sobbed, as though heartbroken. Throughout his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
captivity and when in extreme danger he had not shed
a tear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take heart, lad, an&#8217; let me know what I can do
for ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the boy, struggling with his sobs, had told
him, there was silence for several minutes. Morgan&#8217;s
hand was laid kindly on the boy&#8217;s shoulder, and finally
he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to comfort ye, boy. He wouldn&#8217;t
like ye to mourn. He&#8217;d say, if he could, &#8216;just go ahead
an&#8217; do yer duty.&#8217; Death comes to us all sometime.
An&#8217; I want you to remember that Daniel Morgan&#8217;ll
never be too busy to lend ye a helpin&#8217; hand if it comes
his way.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pressure of the sinewy hand on the boy&#8217;s shoulder
followed the words, and the kindliness it signified
went straight to Rodney&#8217;s heart. He never forgot it.
That day another was added to the full ranks of those
who loved Daniel Morgan and would follow where he
led, though they might know certain death awaited
them.</p>
<p>Governor Dunmore sent runners to the Indian
towns requesting the chiefs to meet him. All complied
with the request save a few in the northerly towns and
Chief Logan. Major Crawford was sent with a force
to destroy the towns of those who had failed to respond
to the request, and in this force went the men
under Morgan. They met with no resistance and,
after burning the villages, the troops returned. An
interpreter and a messenger were sent to Logan, and to
them he is said to have made the memorable speech,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
a model of dignified eloquence and sublime pathos, beginning:
&#8220;I appeal to any white man to say that he
ever entered Logan&#8217;s cabin but I gave him meat.&#8221;
Broken in spirit, he afterwards became a sot and was
killed while in a drunken fury.</p>
<p>Hostages having been taken from among the Indian
chiefs and arrangements made for the return by the
Indians of all whites held captive by them, they promising
to observe the Ohio River as the boundary of
their territory, Governor Dunmore&#8217;s army returned to
Virginia.</p>
<p>On arriving at Fort Gower they were met by the
news that England had closed the port of Boston,
hoping by this arbitrary measure to punish the independent
colonists. This news was doubtless received
by Governor Dunmore with delight, but it was otherwise
with the great majority of those in his army.
Expressions of sympathy for the Bostonians were
heard on all sides. Moreover, Dunmore&#8217;s delight was
to be tempered with chagrin when he heard that the
House of Burgesses had appointed a day of fasting,
as an expression of the Old Dominion&#8217;s disapproval
of England&#8217;s act.</p>
<p>For several months these men of Dunmore&#8217;s army
had been deprived of what many, even in that day of
primitive living, considered necessities. For weeks at
a time they had eaten no salt; they had slept without
other covering than the sky overhead. They were returning
victorious, yet believing that Dunmore, instead
of contributing to that victory, had belittled it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>Self-reliant, hardy, convinced they possessed in their
own strong arms the power to live and rear their families
in this great country of the new world without
interference from England, they spoke very plainly.
Meetings were held, and at one of these a speech was
made which, alluding to what they had been able to
accomplish, concluded: &#8220;Blessed with these talents, let
us solemnly engage to one another, and our country
in particular, that we will use them for no purpose but
for the honour and advantage of America and Virginia
in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>A resolution was passed to bear faithful allegiance
to King George, the Third, &#8220;while his majesty delights
to reign over a free people,&#8221; a proviso worth noting;
also worthy of note is the fact that this resolution
pledged them to do everything in their power for the
defence of American liberty. Indeed, many of the men
shook hands on an agreement to march to the defence
of Boston if necessary. Some of them were to be
called upon to fulfil this promise.</p>
<p>Such demonstrations away out there on the frontier
ought to have served as a warning to the royalists, but
they gave it little heed. The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; forbore to
take part and looked upon the whole affair with a pitying
smile. &#8220;I know of none more in need of being
ruled over, than you, my merry lads,&#8221; he said and
laughed at the scowls in the faces of his associates.
He laughed, too, at the retort of Ferguson, &#8220;Sure,
me gallant warrior, &#8217;tis we as will have a word to say
aboot the ruler an&#8217; how he rules, mind ye.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Ferguson had expressed the temper of the men composing
the army, while the &#8220;Chevalier,&#8221; with his confident
smile, was a type of many throughout the colonies
who did not for a moment doubt the ability of
England to govern the new land as she might wish.</p>
<p>At the post where the men received some of the pay
for their service, Rodney Allison was to undergo
temptations and experiences that were to cause him
bitter reflections. The soldiers had endured privations
and, as frequently happens, many sought relaxation in
debauch at the first opportunity. Liquor was to be
had by those with money to pay for it, and many a
frontiersman would not leave it until his last penny
should be spent and then would resume his life of
wandering and peril. With the drinking there was
gambling with cards and dice.</p>
<p>The drinking had no attraction for young Allison;
on the contrary he looked upon it with deep disgust.
Ordinarily the gambling would have had no fascination
for him. Indeed, until his captivity, he had not
known one card from another. One of the accomplishments
Ahneota had learned from his acquaintance with
white men was the use of cards, for which he had a
great passion, and to please him the boy had spent
many an hour playing various games.</p>
<p>Rodney&#8217;s grief over the reported death of his father,
his dread of returning home with the sad news to face
debt and poverty, coloured his thoughts,&ndash;&ndash;often woke
him from sleep, and made him reckless. As he
watched the games he heard a familiar voice and, looking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
saw Mogridge at a table with large winnings at
his hand. Rodney, from the day they first met, had
cherished an unreasoning dislike for the young Englishman.
He felt, rather than knew, that Mogridge
had been instrumental in having his father dismissed
by Squire Danesford. The boy was shrewd enough
to suspect the fellow had come on with other adventurers
to meet the army and fleece the unsuspecting.
That money at his hand would clear the little home
from debt and assure protection for the family for the
present. How cool and insolent the fellow was!</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry your luck runs so badly. The game&#8217;s much
less interesting, you know,&#8221; Mogridge drawled as he
swept the poor fellow&#8217;s money into his own pile.
Then, looking up and noticing Rodney, though it did
not appear that he recognized him, he said in a bantering
tone, &#8220;Hello, here&#8217;s a young warrior who looks
as if he&#8217;d like to tempt the fair goddess, Chance, with
a sixpence.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the hot blood pounding his temples, and
scarcely knowing what he did, the boy took the proffered
seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a hand, if there be no objection,&#8221; said a
bystander with a wink at Mogridge, which Rodney
could not see.</p>
<p>While the cards were being shuffled the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221;
came along and remarked that the game would
be worth watching. Neither Mogridge nor his &#8220;pal&#8221;
seemed pleased, but the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; remained standing
where he could observe every movement of Rodney&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
antagonists. The cards were dealt and played.
The luck, which so often leads the amateur on to his
downfall, smiled on the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the gentleman from London doesn&#8217;t like the luck
that goes with the warrior&#8217;s sixpence I&#8217;ll let some
worthier foeman have my place,&#8221; said Rodney, who,
now that his excitement had subsided, desired to leave
the game.</p>
<p>Mogridge looked narrowly at the boy, but apparently
failed to recognize him, and he replied, &#8220;Gentlemen
usually grant their antagonists an opportunity to
win back the smiles of the fickle goddess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deal,&#8221; replied Rodney with an air of importance
he was far from feeling.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; yet loitered near, and luck continued
to run in Rodney&#8217;s favour. After four hands,
and with quite a little pile of winnings before him, he
wanted to leave the game, but was ashamed to do so.
Then Mogridge said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s double the stake,&#8221; which
was done. The cards were dealt, and the play was begun,
when the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; coolly remarked, &#8220;Card
exposed. You&#8217;ll have to deal over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mogridge&#8217;s little eyes looked like tiny, glowing
coals, and closer to his long nose than ever, but the
cards were dealt again, and again the boy won. Then
Mogridge and his confederate rose and left the table
while Rodney sat gloating over his winnings.</p>
<p>&#8220;One who would accustom himself to the whimsies
of Fortune must learn to lose as well as to win. In
your behalf I will endeavour to instruct you in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
part of the game, my boy. Won&#8217;t you gentlemen remain
to see that I pluck the winner fairly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to such small game. We didn&#8217;t
know we were poaching on your preserves,&#8221; replied
Mogridge in a surly tone, walking away.</p>
<p>Rodney was surprised. He had no desire to play
with his friend. Yet in a masterful way the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221;
appeared to take it for granted that they would
play, and proceeded to deal the cards. The boy shrank
from saying or doing anything which would excite the
man&#8217;s ridicule, for he had come to regard him as a
superior sort of a person, and was somewhat in awe
of his rather grand manner.</p>
<p>The first game Rodney won. Then the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221;
remarked, as though he were doing the lad a
favour, &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll not prolong this; I must be going.
Here&#8217;s my wager.&#8221;</p>
<p>To meet it required the last shilling of the boy&#8217;s
winnings, but he staked it all, and the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221;
won, coolly swept the money into his pocket, all but a
few shillings which he carelessly shoved toward the
boy, saying, &#8220;You&#8217;ll need those to get home. It&#8217;s bad
practice to wager one&#8217;s last farthing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friends of Rodney Allison would not have recognized
him now as the same fellow he was an hour
before. Fury filled him to overflowing. That coveted
money was gone and his own with it, taken by a man
whose life he once had saved, his supposed friend,
who now had plucked him as one would a pigeon. He
seized the money and threw it in the Chevalier&#8217;s face,
then, as he reflected what his act signified, he grasped
the handle of his knife in readiness to defend himself.</p>

&#8220;HE SEIZED THE MONEY AND THREW IT IN THE CHEVALIER&#8217;S FACE.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; fixed his handsome eyes on the
boy. His face was pale but those burning eyes held the
lad as under a spell. Then the man spoke, his words
as cool as ice, his voice low but painfully distinct: &#8220;One
might think, my boy, you had staked your character,
your soul, and lost. That&#8217;s what the gambler does.
I did not realize this till I had killed my best friend.
You will understand my motives better when you
learn more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away. The boy looked after him, and
shame quenched the fury in his heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>SOMEWHAT OF A MYSTERY</h3>
</div>
<p>A long, dusty road swept by the bleak wind of
a November day. A boy, young man he
seemed in his ragged frontier garb, trudged
wearily on. The long rifle he carried had a fancifully
carved stock, once the pride of a veteran Wyandotte
chief.</p>
<p>The lad&#8217;s face was worn and thin and, by reason of
long exposure, almost the colour of an Indian&#8217;s.
&#8220;Four miles further to Charlottesville,&#8221; he said, and
threw himself down beside the road as one exhausted.
At the sound of a galloping horse he looked up with
dull, sullen eyes, into which there came a flash of recognition
and he cried, &#8220;Nat, old boy!&#8221; The horse
stopped so quickly his rider narrowly escaped being
unhorsed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in thunder are you doing? er&ndash;&ndash;shadder of
old black Tom! is it you, Rodney Allison, or your
ghost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like a ghost, Angus, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m
heavy enough to bother Nat if we ride double back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
town. How is mother and &#8217;Omi? and how did you
come by Nat? Is the place gone? I feared Denham
had the colt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard that ghosts could ask questions or
I&#8217;d sure think ye was one. Ride double? You bet ye
can, an&#8217; if thar ain&#8217;t horse enough, I&#8217;ll walk. Give us
yer hand, thar, now I&#8217;ll answer the rest o&#8217; yer questions.
The folks are right smart but powerful anxious
fer yer dad. Reckon they&#8217;d lost hope o&#8217; seein&#8217; you
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father was killed in the battle at Point Pleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer father killed! An&#8217; he thought you was dead.
He was a good man, Rodney. Everybody&#8217;ll be mighty
sorry to hear that,&#8221; and then, words failing, he said
no more and in silence they arrived at the Allison
home. Angus led the colt to the stable while Rodney
entered the house.</p>
<p>Mam saw him first, and for a moment she was almost
a white woman. His mother fainted and his little
sister ran from him in terror. But why attempt to describe
that which words fail to express? Tragedies
were not uncommon in the frontier homes of that day
in this new land, and wives and mothers were heroines,
though the great outside world never was to learn their
names and Fame could not record them.</p>
<p>Angus with true delicacy went to his home, but
later in the day called, and the two boys had a long
talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t answered my questions, yet, Angus.
I haven&#8217;t felt like talking business with mother. I find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
poor old Thello sick and I don&#8217;t know as Mam will
ever get over her scare at sight of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thello&#8217;s bein&#8217; sick was why I was exercisin&#8217; the
colt. I say, Rodney, old Denham mighty nigh owned
the critter, and the place to boot. He&#8217;d got his thumb
right on &#8217;em when along come a feller as told him to
take it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that Denham was&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;foreclosin&#8217;,
that&#8217;s the word, when this man interfered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What man? Not Mr. Jefferson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He would, though, if he&#8217;d been round home
an&#8217; known about it; but he&#8217;s away most the time. No,
I don&#8217;t know who the man was. Yer mother may
know fer he left the deed with her. Ye see, &#8217;twas this
way. I met him ridin&#8217; like the wind. His nag was all
of a lather. He pulled up an&#8217; says, &#8216;Can you tell me
where the Allison home is?&#8217; I says, &#8216;I reckon I can,
it&#8217;s right over thar.&#8217; He kept on an&#8217; met ol&#8217; Denham
leadin&#8217; Nat out&#8217;n the stable. I dunno what was said,
but I saw &#8217;em an&#8217; moused right along down whar they
was talkin&#8217;. Yer mother had gone to the village. Well,
when I got within earshot, I heard the man say, &#8216;I&#8217;ve
got the money right here.&#8217; Denham didn&#8217;t act as
though he had any use for money, which looked
mighty funny. But the man, he was a masterful one,
I tell ye,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Mr. Jefferson sent him. What&#8217;d he look
like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I dunno. He was one o&#8217; the quality, I c&#8217;d see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
that with half an eye. Anyhow he jes&#8217; tol&#8217; Denham
to take that money an&#8217; Denham &#8217;lowed he wouldn&#8217;t.
Then the man, he says, &#8216;You&#8217;ll take that money an&#8217;
give me a deed o&#8217; that Allison place, free an&#8217; clear, or
I&#8217;ll fight ye through the courts an&#8217; I&#8217;ll win.&#8217; Denham,
he hemmed an&#8217; hawed, but the man wouldn&#8217;t stand fer
no foolin&#8217; an&#8217; Denham, he wilted. They went down
to the Squire&#8217;s to fix the matter up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew who he was or how I&#8217;m going to
pay him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t reckon ye got to pay him. Yer mother&#8217;s got
the deed fer I see him give it to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a debt of honour, Angus. You must help me
to think up some way to make a living, and something
besides, off the old place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll figger it out certain sure, Rodney. You&#8217;ve
got a home as no one can take away from ye if ye don&#8217;t
mortgage it.&#8221;</p>
<p>On his return to the house Rodney asked his mother
about the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very strange to me. The gentleman, and it
was very evident that he was one, called and handed
me a paper, saying, &#8216;Madam, there is the deed to
your home. I understand that leaves you free of
debt. I do not wish to seem impertinent but am I
correct?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I knew of no other obligations. I said:
&#8216;You are very kind and I am deeply grateful if I do
not seem so. It is hard for one unaccustomed to charity
to accept it, you know. I must know to whom I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
am indebted, for I certainly hope the time may come
when it may be repaid.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His reply was, &#8216;This is not given as charity. It
is to repay a debt owed to one very dear to you and I
am not at liberty to mention the debtor&#8217;s name. I assure
you, however, that it is not charity, but the payment
of an obligation. The only request is, that this
home, never, so long as in your possession, be mortgaged
again.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father was always helping people and saying nothing
about it,&#8221; replied Rodney, and the tears came to his
eyes.</p>
<p>They sat many minutes looking into the open fire.
Then Mrs. Allison said: &#8220;Rodney, I wish you would
go to the closet in my room and get the little trunk
in which your father kept his papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy brought back a little leather-bound trunk,
neatly ornamented and secured with brass headed tacks.</p>
<p>Mrs. Allison was a woman of strong character and,
after the shock of hearing the report of her husband&#8217;s
death, took up her duties with composure, though the
lines in her face seemed deeper, and Rodney saw that
an errant lock of her hair, which he had always
thought a part of the attractiveness of her fair face,
was now quite gray, and, as she pushed it aside, a
familiar way she had, he noticed how thin and white
her hand was and saw that it trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I put the deed in the trunk with the other
papers, the day it was brought to me, I noticed a sealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
paper there, which I think we perhaps should open,&#8221;
saying which she took it and held it out that her son
might read the inscription, which was: &#8220;To be opened
by my dear wife after my death, if she should survive,
otherwise to be burned unread.&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke the seal and read, the boy watching her
face as she did so. Having read it, she allowed it to
lie in her lap for a time, and then gave it to Rodney,
and this is what he read, his wonder increasing with
every line:</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>My Beloved Wife</span>:&ndash;&ndash;As you read this you may
recall the last evening in the old home before we came
to Charlottesville. I sat by the window and you said,
&#8216;It is a pretty picture, David, the water in the creek,
in the sunset colours, looks like wine and the road is
a brown ribbon on green velvet. But perhaps you are
not thinking of that at all. Sometimes, David, I think
there is a part of your life in which I do not live.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not see me start at those words, for they
were true. After you had retired I sat for a long time
and then it became clear to me that you should know
in good time that other part of my life, for there really
was another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had not seen the colours on the creek nor the
brown ribbon on the green velvet, as I sat by the window.
Instead I saw the streets of old Edinburgh, the
shadows heavy in the Greyfriars&#8217; churchyard, the
familiar scenes along High Street of an evening, when
the students were out laughing and joking, strolling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
along, each with hand on the other&#8217;s shoulder, and
I among them. For I was as care-free as any one of
them all. The good mother had not let me see that
she was making any sacrifice in giving me those years
at the University, and I was confident of the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you of those days, but not that my
mates knew me as David Cameron,&ndash;&ndash;David Allison
Cameron, to be exact, Allison being my mother&#8217;s name.
&#8216;Why should you change it?&#8217; I can hear you ask, apprehension
in your voice. That is the part of my life
in which you are now to share. Nor do I clearly know
why you have not been permitted to do so before. It
was no guilt of mine that caused me to change my
name, except, possibly, that I was influenced by pride.
My father&#8217;s brother was a merchant in Glasgow, who
urged that I become his apprentice. Mother was all
for having me educated. I think the dear soul hoped
to hear me expound in the kirk, as possibly she might
but for the cold that came upon her and, before I
realized what it meant, the good doctor was telling
me it would be her last illness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! the mists hung heavy over the lowlands the
morning I turned my face toward London, where I
was determined to seek fame and fortune. I might
have gone to my uncle in Glasgow, but no, mother had
wished otherwise and I was as proud as I was inexperienced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not pain you with a recital of the struggles
I endured until, as I thought, Fortune came to my
relief and Lord Ralston engaged me as the tutor of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
his son, Dick. And, when I saw the lad, my happiness
was complete. He was a handsome fellow, generous to
a fault, and his pleasant smile and hearty greeting won
me at the first. The stipend, to one impoverished as
I was, seemed munificent, but I soon found that Handsome
Dick, as he was called, made sure the spending
of it should not trouble me. He could borrow a pound
or two as if doing one a favour, and I knew it was with
the firm intention that I should have it back. This,
however, he found so inconvenient I rarely had enough
to help him out of scrapes when his own funds were
wasted. Admonitions to him were like the falling rain
on the back of the duck. He early acquired a passion
for gambling. His father knew it, but hoped that time
would work his cure. He, himself, I learned, had been
somewhat of a profligate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved the boy and life with him would have been
a pleasure but for the anxious moments when it seemed
he would go headlong to perdition despite my utmost
efforts. Once, I thought, he seemed inclined to mend
his ways, when, after the manner of youth, he met a
young lady in whose eyes he thought his happiness to
lie. For a time his passion for cards was forgotten,
and neither White&#8217;s nor the Coffee House saw him for
months. But she went abroad and he became restless.
Then came news of her marriage and he returned to
his first love, the gaming table. Do what I might I
could not restrain him. He was perfectly reckless.
Soon he was in debt and his father, when it was too
late, sought to check him and cut down his allowance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
From associates at White&#8217;s he descended to the lower
resorts. There was one fellow that I specially feared,
and with whom he had become a boon companion, a
Captain Villecourt, a gambler and a rake, whose reputation
was unsavoury. I pleaded, but in vain. I could
not desert the boy. He loved me, and I him, and so
I dogged his footsteps, helped him out of difficulty
whenever I could, and lost no opportunity for pleading
his cause with his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;One night, I shall never forget it, word came that
his father was ill. The laddie was out and I thought
he had gone to meet Villecourt, who lived in a low
tavern and frequently did not dare venture abroad for
fear of meeting his creditors and being lodged where
he belonged, in a debtor&#8217;s gaol.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a villainous place. A dismal rain was falling,
the street was poorly lighted, and, but for the
mean attire I put on, I might easily have become the
victim of footpads.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not a welcome caller at the tavern, was told
with an oath that neither Villecourt nor Ralston was
in the house. There seemed nothing to do, and I
turned down the ill-smelling passage leading to the side
entrance, when, from a room on the right, I heard
Dick&#8217;s strong young voice cry out, &#8216;You are a knave,
sir!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to open the door; it was bolted. I threw
myself against it and the rotten casing yielded, the
door burst open. The room was in semi-darkness, one
candle, along with the cards, having been upset and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
knocked to the floor. Dick with uplifted cane stood
over the cowering Villecourt. Hearing the noise of
the bursting door, and doubtless thinking Villecourt&#8217;s
friends were coming to the rescue, he wheeled and
struck me a savage blow.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long I remained unconscious I do not know.
I awoke with an aching head on a pallet of filthy straw.
The place I was in was in utter darkness. I listened
for any sound which might explain my situation. The
vile odours of a ship&#8217;s hold, the sound of water, and
a slight sense of motion convinced me I was on shipboard!
I felt in my pockets, but they had been rifled!</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell asleep, or fainted, and was again awakened
with an oath. I was on board a ship bound from London
to Norfolk, Virginia, and soon learned that I not
only was to work but would be sold on arrival there
for a sum equivalent to the cost of passage. How I
toiled until I secured my freedom!</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the rest, except my motive for not
giving my full name. That I scarcely know myself,
but suppose shame at the condition in which I found
myself led me into the deception, and I adopted the
first name that suggested itself. Afterward, an explanation
would have been embarrassing and apparently
of no value, yet I much regret the mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of Dick Ralston I have never
learned. He may have been killed, and the crime laid
at my door. The place he was in was one convenient
for such a crime. Had he lived I am sure he would
have prevented my being put aboard the ship, for he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
was as brave and loyal to a friend as he was reckless.
As for the name Allison, it is as honourable as the
other, and I intend now to retain it and hope you will
appreciate the wisdom of so doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life at times seems a failure, but that is when
I am thinking of the little of this world&#8217;s gear I have
accumulated for my family. In you, beloved, and in
our dear children, I am blessed beyond my deserts.
That you may forgive my unintentional deception, and
never have cause to suffer by reason of it, is my daily
prayer. Believe me, your affectionate husband,</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>&#8220;David Allison.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>RODNEY RIDES WITH DISPATCHES</h3>
</div>
<p>Rodney had been at home but a short time
when he realized that important events had
occurred in his absence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said one day, &#8220;it looks as though the
king will have to send over a new governor in place
of Lord Dunmore, or there&#8217;ll be trouble. You know,
Colonel Lewis and his men were mad enough to fight
both him and the Indians because, instead of punishing
the Indians, he made peace with &#8217;em. I hear he had
trouble before he left Virginia on the expedition over
the mountains, and is having it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he dissolved the Assembly because, out of
sympathy with Boston, it appointed a fast day. England,
you know, closed the port of Boston. The year
before Governor Dunmore dissolved the Assembly because
it expressed sympathy with Massachusetts. I
fear he is too arbitrary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they do as they have a mind to after all.
Last year, I understand, Mr. Jefferson and Colonel
Washington and others met at the old Raleigh Tavern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
and arranged to have correspondence with all
the colonies so they could all act together if necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they also met there five years ago and resolved
not to import goods from England, and, before
they went home last June, they met at the same place
and planned for the Colonial Congress they held in
Philadelphia last September. I believe these meetings
were in what is called the Apollo room. I remember
dancing there when I was a girl. It is a large room
with a big fireplace at one end. I expect the king&#8217;s ears
would tingle if he could hear all the angry words that
have been spoken against tyranny in that room. Oh, I
don&#8217;t know what it all will come to. There must be
faults on both sides. I think Patrick Henry is too
impetuous for a safe leader. I&#8217;ve been told that he
believes the colonies should declare themselves independent
of England. That would mean a terrible war.
I do hope we may escape such a calamity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The king had heard of the words spoken in the
Apollo room of the old tavern. Governor Dunmore,
an irritable, haughty Scotch nobleman, with little respect
for the people, also had heard enough to fill his
heart with rage. He sent the legislators, many of
whom had ridden many miles to the capital at Williamsburg,
back home with his disapproval. He would
teach them submission!</p>
<p>On their part, the people had no thought of submission.
Wherever they met there was a sound as of
angry bees.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think our people must have much of right on
their side, or such men as Colonel Washington, who
is an aristocrat with much to lose and very conservative,
&#8217;tis said, would not favour what is being done in
opposition to the British ministry,&#8221; said Mrs. Allison.
Rodney, while seeing the matter largely through his
mother&#8217;s eyes, nevertheless recalled the words he had
heard fall from the lips of the rough frontiersmen.
He knew that they were ready to fight, indeed many
of them eager for a conflict, confident that they, who
could clear the land, build homes in the wilderness
and defend them against the Indians, could likewise
defy the tyranny of King George. The boy became
restless. He wanted to participate in the agitation
which was noticeable on all sides, indeed the air seemed
charged with it.</p>
<p>There was little work to be done on the farm during
the winter. Hearing that Mr. Jefferson was then at
his home, Rodney decided to visit Monticello. There
he met with a warm greeting, though a shade of disappointment
was in his face when he learned that the
great man had been so busy he had not followed the
fortunes of the Allison family, and did not even know
that Mr. Allison had fallen at the battle of Point Pleasant.
For the first time Rodney now doubted whether
after all the man who had paid off the mortgage, and
thwarted Denham, was really an agent of Mr. Jefferson.
Finally, an opportunity came for assuring himself.
His host was admiring Nat when Rodney said:
&#8220;The colt is in fine condition, handsomer than ever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
I nearly lost him. Denham wanted him and, when he
started to foreclose, he took possession of Nat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Denham foreclosed? Have you then lost the
home? I wish I had known of it, I might have prevented
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some kind friend learned of it and paid the mortgage;
neither mother nor I know who it was. I
thought he might have been your agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you think I would have assisted had I
known, but this is the first I have heard of the matter.
You see I have been very busy and away from home
much, and not in a way to hear. I&#8217;m very glad you
were rescued from the clutches of Denham.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He seemed determined to have both the place and
the horse. Both Thello and Mam offered to sell themselves,
even suggested that to Denham, but he told
them he didn&#8217;t want any old, worn out niggers on his
hands. I&#8217;m glad I wasn&#8217;t there,&#8221; and the lad&#8217;s eyes
blazed with indignation as he thought of the old
miser&#8217;s greed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denham is said to be as ardent a Tory as he dares
to be,&#8221; remarked Mr. Jefferson, as though to himself.
Then, turning to the boy, he looked into his face, and
Rodney felt as though his inmost thoughts were being
read.</p>
<p>That he stood the test well appeared in the next
words of Jefferson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe your experience with the Indians has
greatly matured you. How old are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am well on to sixteen, sir.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; replied his host with a smile,
&#8220;you are fifteen with ardent hope of soon being sixteen,
and I&#8217;ll warrant extremely desirous of active and
honourable employment. The colt, too, looks as
though he wanted to exercise his faculties as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I am very anxious for employment. There
is not much I can do at home this winter. Indeed, the
little place will barely afford existence and I need to
earn money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I have in mind will demand discretion and
judgment beyond your years, as well as fidelity to a
trust. Of your fidelity I have no question, and am inclined
to believe that, with your intelligence and the
experience you have had, you will be able to meet the
requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you give me a chance, Mr. Jefferson?&#8221;
There was pleading in the boy&#8217;s eyes and in the tone
of his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rodney, I will, with your mother&#8217;s permission.
You explain to her, but tell no one else, that the work
will consist in carrying messages to different parts of
the colony. Supervision of the work being done by
the various committees of safety, and quick and reliable
communication between the men taking the lead in this
business, require such service as you will be expected
to perform. Nat looks as though he might be depended
on for the quickness, and to you must be left the discretion.
You must have eyes as well as ears and use
both more than the tongue. The employment will not
be without slight danger, for, after a time, our opponents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
will inevitably discover what you are doing.
Then, in the present unsettled state of things, the long
rides, some of the time at night, will demand courage
and prudence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure mother will consent. There certainly won&#8217;t
be the danger there was living among the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled. &#8220;I doubt if your mother would
consent to expose you to those conditions again. I
will write to her and you may be the bearer of the
message and plead your cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the letter finally in his pocket, and Nat making
use of a free rein to gallop like the wind, Rodney Allison
felt as though he were entering upon a new world
with much more of sunshine and hope than for a long
time he had known. The following week he began his
duties by setting out for Mount Vernon with a message
for Colonel Washington, and another for Richard
Henry Lee, who, also, had been a delegate to the first
Colonial Congress.</p>
<p>Angus saw that something was afoot and was displeased
at Rodney for not taking him into his confidence.
&#8220;Where now, Rodney?&#8221; he said, as he
sauntered into the Allison yard, where his friend was
bidding his mother good-bye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to take quite a long ride on one of Mr.
Jefferson&#8217;s business matters; I don&#8217;t quite know how
far it will take me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go prepared for trouble,&#8221; replied Angus with
a nod at the butts of two horse-pistols which could be
seen under the flaps of the holsters.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Those are some father had with the saddle,&#8221; replied
Rodney.</p>
<p>Angus winked and said no more, though it was
evident he would like to have done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye, Angus, and good-bye, mother.
Don&#8217;t expect me back till I get here,&#8221; said Rodney,
vaulting into the saddle and riding away at a furious
gallop, his head up and shoulders thrown back and as
full of a sense of his own importance as is permitted to
a modest lad, such as Rodney Allison really was.</p>
<p>Before him lay long stretches of miserable roads,
clogged with snow or mud, a bleak landscape, not to
mention many inconveniences which the travellers
through that region were then obliged to endure. But
all things come to an end and so, one crisp morning,
the lad reined Ned into the road leading to Mount
Vernon.</p>
<p>Now, those of us who visit the place feel that we
approach the shrine of our country. To Rodney it was
a visit to one of the finest plantations in all the Old
Dominion, and its owner was one of the most influential
citizens as well as one of the wealthiest. The general
appearance of the place that morning was much
as one now finds it, save for the evidences then seen
of the little army of negroes who worked on the plantation.
The smoke curled lazily up into the frosty air;
the majestic Potomac flowed past between bleak banks
on which the first green of spring had not shown itself.
A kinky haired coloured boy was promptly on hand
to hold the horse, and another met him at the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Talk as little as possible and see everything,&#8221; was
his mother&#8217;s parting advice, and he thought of it as
he looked about him. On all sides were evidences of
thrift and he felt the atmosphere of home.</p>
<p>How Washington loomed before the lad&#8217;s eyes on
entering the room! Not that he was unduly long of
limb, for, though a giant in stature, he was perfectly
proportioned; but he seemed to fill the room with his
presence. Rodney had wondered how he would compare
with the man he so ardently admired, but he could
find no point of resemblance between the man who
greeted him and the host of Monticello, save in the
courteous, kindly manner of both. The boy&#8217;s first
thought was of the masterful manner of the man before
him, yet those calm, blue-gray eyes, looking out
from under the heavy brows, did not embarrass him.</p>
<p>This is the man who Ahneota believed was guarded
by the Great Spirit, was the thought which flashed
through his mind as Washington extended his hand in
greeting, the man who had dared take Governor Dinwiddie&#8217;s
message into the enemy&#8217;s country, who had
saved the remnants of Braddock&#8217;s panic-stricken
troops amid a hail of bullets. How could such a
massive figure have escaped, with men falling all
around him?</p>
<p>Rodney delivered his message and received a reply,
was introduced to Mrs. Washington and given refreshments
and departed rejoicing that his new work
was affording him such pleasant experiences. What
satisfaction it must be, he thought, to be so rich, have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
such a fine home and be respected by all one&#8217;s neighbours.
If he had such a plantation as this he would
hunt and fish to his heart&#8217;s content, and Lisbeth Danesford
would be proud to introduce him to her cousins
from London, and he would not condescend to notice
them either, unless they were different from Mogridge,
the insolent fellow! What had become of him? Anyhow,
though the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; finally had gotten the
money, there was the satisfaction of winning it from
Mogridge. Ah! Rodney, you were not experienced
in the tricks of gambling or you would have known
that, but for the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; watching them, Mogridge
and his &#8220;pal&#8221; would have stripped you of every
farthing.</p>
<p>Rodney had read the letter Lisbeth had written from
London. He was glad she was finding the nobility,
the lords and dukes, not to mention duchesses, such
uninteresting people, and that she longed for Virginia.
Had she come home? It would be but little out of his
way to ride around past &#8220;The Hall.&#8221; No, he would
not call, for he would not wish to meet the squire
after the shabby manner in which he had treated them.
Possibly he might meet Lisbeth on the road. She
was a mighty fine girl, and, if she did get him into that
scrape with Roscome&#8217;s bull, she had gotten him out.
From the girl his thoughts reverted to the man he had
just left.</p>
<p>The boy recalled that firm mouth, the grave dignity,
and the something about his personality which had
said to the lad as to others: &#8220;You can trust me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
Rodney Allison was never afterward to doubt George
Washington. The next year, when it was said Washington
had declared that if necessary he would raise a
thousand men at his own expense and march them to
Boston, Rodney exclaimed, &#8220;He&#8217;ll do it, too!&#8221; When
Boston was evacuated he said, &#8220;I knew it.&#8221; When
Washington, in the face of all sorts of difficulties, led
his scattering forces in masterly retreat before the victorious
British, Rodney was to say, &#8220;He&#8217;s doing all
that man can do.&#8221; But this is getting ahead of the
story, for young Allison is now on his way to the
home of Richard Henry Lee, who later was to propose
independence in the Continental Congress, when to do
so might mean loss of not only his property but his life
as well, for King George would have liked to make an
example of at least a few prominent &#8220;traitors,&#8221; could
he have got them in his clutches.</p>
<p>The meeting with Mr. Lee was for Rodney another
pleasant experience; a fine man, and what an agreeable
voice he had! Then the lad turned Nat&#8217;s head toward
home, well pleased with the success that so far had
attended his journey.</p>
<p>Two days of travelling brought him to the neighbourhood
of his old home. He was aware of a dull
ache in his throat as he rode by the school house. It
seemed as if he saw his father bowed over the rude
bench within. In the distance he caught a glimpse of
&#8220;The Hall.&#8221; There was a feeling of homesickness
with it all, and he would have given all that his scant
purse contained to see Lisbeth and have her know that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
he had become a person of some importance. Wouldn&#8217;t
the squire rave if he knew the errands he had in charge.
Ah, but those stiff-necked Tories would have to yield!</p>
<p>As he rode past &#8220;The Hall&#8221; he looked long at the
house. The squire galloped up behind and passed him
with a stare and a salute, not recognizing him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder he didn&#8217;t remember Nat,&#8221; thought Rodney,
and it was surprising because the squire was a
great admirer of a good horse and knew the &#8220;points&#8221;
of all the best in the county.</p>
<p>A little farther along lived the Roscomes. There he
was sure of finding a place to spend the night. It was
then about four in the afternoon. He would have time
to get his supper and then ride up on the hill for one
more look at the familiar view.</p>
<p>The Roscomes, father and son, owned but a small
plantation, but their hospitality was princely and it was
with difficulty he got away for the hill.</p>
<p>Hitching Nat in a grove at the foot, he climbed to
the top just in season to see the sunset and the extended
view, which had been so familiar to him, so that he
felt well repaid. On his way back, and as he was unhitching
the horse, he heard voices in the road which
ran near the grove.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, me &#8217;earty, I&#8217;ve about enough o&#8217; this dirty
country. I&#8217;d like to put me two legs across the back
of a fine &#8217;orse, an&#8217; I&#8217;d ask no questions of the owner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right ye are, Bill. At the speed we&#8217;re walkin&#8217;
we&#8217;ll git to Occoquan about midsummer, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve &#8217;orses in plenty &#8217;ereabout to go with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
muddy roads. They&#8217;d not miss a couple, though they
think more of a &#8217;orse than they do of a nigger, I&#8217;m
told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have two an&#8217; ask no questions, but they&#8217;ve
both dogs and niggers, an&#8217; one or both always sleeps
in the stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell ye wot, d&#8217;ye mind the lad and girl go riding
by when we was eatin&#8217; a bite beside the road, along
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did an&#8217; thought ridin&#8217; would do me a sight more
good than them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;ave no guns an&#8217; would be easy to
scare. Suppose if we meet &#8217;em we give &#8217;em the &#8217;int
an&#8217; not wait for an answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have the whole country at our heels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; there wouldn&#8217;t be a &#8217;orse in the lot could overtake
us or me eye knows not a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney looked to the priming of his pistols, then
mounted Nat and followed slowly after the men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>RODNEY TO THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>
<p>It would not be true to say that Rodney Allison
was not nervous as he gripped the handle of the
big pistol he drew from its holster, and cocked it.</p>
<p>Whether the men were armed he did not know. If
they failed to meet the two riders they sought they
might conclude one horse would be better than none
and attack him. Indeed, this seemed very probable;
besides, if they should attack the other parties, the boy
resolved he would take a hand in the affair.</p>
<p>A little farther on, the road on which he was riding
crossed the highway leading to Roscome&#8217;s. The men
probably were waiting at the corner. He decided to
ride slowly and await developments.</p>
<p>In event of attack he would spur Nat directly against
them and use the pistol!</p>
<p>The frogs were croaking in the nearby meadow.
The sound jarred on his tense nerves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, sir, be this the road to Occoquan?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had met some one! Rodney stopped his horse
and listened. A horse whinnied, and Nat lifted his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
head to reply when a touch from the spur changed his
mind.</p>
<p>A clear voice rang out, &#8220;Back, you knaves! Take
your hands off that bridle!&#8221;</p>
<p>A girl&#8217;s scream and sounds of a struggle came to
the lad&#8217;s ears, and he spurred ahead.</p>
<p>Near the corners of the roads, though now dusk had
fallen, he discerned two riders on horses that were
rearing and plunging. One of the riders, a man, was
plying his whip over the head of the fellow who clung
to his bridle; on the other horse was a girl struggling
with a rascal who was trying to pull her from the
animal&#8217;s back. Rodney turned his attention to this
one.</p>
<p>Not daring to fire, through fear of hitting the girl,
he rode straight at the miscreant and, clubbing his
pistol, struck him over the head what proved to be but
a slight blow, for the man dodged, but his hold was
broken and he staggered back, and Nat trampled over
him. His accomplice, seeing this, fled. The girl hung
by the side of her horse, one foot in the stirrup and
both hands clutching his mane. Thoroughly frightened,
he plunged ahead and ran wildly down the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will be dashed to death!&#8221; was the thought
which flashed through Rodney&#8217;s mind and, wheeling his
horse, he spurred after the fleeing thoroughbred, the
girl&#8217;s companion galloping behind.</p>
<p>The spirit of a racing ancestry, and the cruel rowels,
drove Nat close on the flanks of the runaway. Could
he overtake and pass him?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>The girl was unable to regain her seat, and at every
leap of her horse was tossed, now almost touching the
ground, and again almost as high as the horse&#8217;s back.
Could she retain her grip until Rodney might reach the
bridle rein?</p>
<p>Every moment the boy expected to see her dashed
to the ground and trampled to death under the hoofs
of the running horses. He shut his eyes for an instant,
and then urged faithful Nat to the utmost, and could
feel his muscles respond to the strain.</p>
<p>Inch by inch, Nat gained on the runaway. The boy
leaned far out to seize the loose bridle rein. He could
not quite reach it; another foot and he would have it
within his grasp. Ah! Now he gripped it and pulled
both horses to a stop, crying, &#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m not&ndash;&ndash;sure. Not seriously, I think;
somewhat like Doctor Atterbury&#8217;s prescriptions, &#8216;well
shaken before taken.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Lisbeth&#8217;s voice!</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, Nat. Here, let me help. Isn&#8217;t your ankle
wrenched? If I&#8217;d known who it was I&#8217;d been scared
worse than I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Rodney Allison! Where in the world did
you come from? I was wishing some knight errant
would happen along to stop Firefly; but I never
imagined you in that r&ocirc;le. I&ndash;&ndash;I think you&#8217;ll have to
help me up, my ankle is beginning to complain at the
rough treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney lifted Lisbeth into her saddle just as her
escort and Black Tom rode up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Enderwood, this is my old playmate, Rodney
Allison. He and I always were getting into scrapes.
I&#8217;m going to ask him to sell Nat to father so my escorts
can have as good a horse as Firefly. The one
you have, Mr. Enderwood, has seen his best days and
was no match for mine. But for you, Nat, I should
have had a longer ride than&ndash;&ndash;would have been agreeable.&#8221;
There was a little catch in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Nat gets all the glory and Enderwood is excused
for being behind,&#8221; thought Rodney, not altogether
pleased, and he scarcely heard the old darky
saying by way of apology: &#8220;I suttinly hab no &#8217;scuse
on &#8217;count o&#8217; hoss. Don&#8217; put no nose front o&#8217; yo&#8217;,
Moleskin,&#8221; he said, patting the sleek neck of the fiery
hunter he rode. &#8220;I&#8217;se &#8217;lowin&#8217; Tom&#8217;s room&#8217;s better&#8217;n
his comp&#8217;ny, an&#8217; was sojerin&#8217; along. But I&#8217;se boun&#8217; ter
say, Marse Rodney, I couldn&#8217; done better myse&#8217;f.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Rodney&#8217;s way of doing things, you know,
Tom,&#8221; said Lisbeth, and the boy&#8217;s feelings were somewhat
soothed by the balm in her words. &#8220;Having
rescued the maid,&#8221; she said, turning to him, &#8220;it&#8217;s now
your duty to return with her to the castle, and explain
to her papa that it was none of her fault, and afford
us all opportunity to thank you properly, while Aunt
Betty gets out her bandages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, but, you see, I&#8217;ve made arrangements
to stay over the night at Roscomes&#8217; and they are expecting
me. I supped there and then thought I wanted
to see the view from the hill, once more. Now I must
return.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So you were going through Pryndale without calling
on your old friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be most happy to call on the morrow if I
may be permitted,&#8221; was Rodney&#8217;s response, and he
was really surprised at his ready reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to ride as far as Roscomes&#8217; with him,&#8221;
said Lisbeth, and, because of the dusk, they could not
see how pale and drawn was her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those villains will have no stomach for further
trouble, I reckon, and I&#8217;m sure you need Aunt Betty
and the bandages more than I do the escort. I hope
to see you in the morning, none the worse for to-night&#8217;s
experience. Good night,&#8221; saying which, he rode on to
Roscome&#8217;s. His mind was in a whirl and, now the
danger and excitement were past, he felt very weak,
and trembled when he thought of Lisbeth&#8217;s peril; yet
he was conscious that he had borne himself well. Then
he fell to wondering who young Enderwood might be.
Rodney had only seen in the dim light that he was
young, not much older than himself, and apparently a
gentleman. Enderwood? Why, he must be Squire
Enderwood&#8217;s son, from Norfolk. If so, he had both
family and fortune, and somehow the idea didn&#8217;t please
Rodney, though why should he begrudge young Enderwood
such an inheritance?</p>
<p>The following morning Rodney set out for &#8220;The
Hall.&#8221; He felt he could ill spare the time but nevertheless
was glad of the opportunity, though he dreaded
the meeting with the squire. His father might be alive
at that moment but for the injustice of Lisbeth&#8217;s father.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>The sun shone brightly but the air was clear and
cold. From a light rain of the previous night icicles
had formed on the trees and gleamed like so many
jewels. It seemed to the boy as though he had dreamed
a long dream of wild forests, peopled with Indians,
and was now awake and at home.</p>
<p>When Rodney arrived at &#8220;The Hall&#8221; he was met
by the squire, who came to him with outstretched
hands, saying, &#8220;My boy, you are a brave lad, and
have placed me under greater obligations than I can
ever hope to repay. I will write your father and tell
him how grateful I am, and how proud he should be
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father is dead, sir; he was killed in the battle
at Point Pleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m astounded! I hadn&#8217;t
heard a word. Why, only the other day I was thinking
of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unmistakable signs of grief in the squire&#8217;s face
somewhat softened Rodney&#8217;s feelings. &#8220;You know
Charlottesville did not afford father the opportunity
to provide for his family as he wished and so he went
over the mountains to take up land. When I was on
my way to him I was captured by the Indians and held
for a year. Meanwhile father, thinking I was dead,
joined the army under General Lewis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never should have let him go away. I&#8217;ve wished
him back every day since he went away,&#8221; and then the
squire turned and walked to the window, where Mogridge
had watched the effect of his plot and seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
David Allison turn his back and walk away never to
return.</p>
<p>At this moment Enderwood came into the room.
He was a fine looking fellow of nearly twenty, straight
and rather tall, with dark hair and eyes, and had an
air of breeding. Greeting Rodney cordially, as he
looked at him keenly, he said, &#8220;Aunt Betty requested
me to tell you that Lisbeth cannot leave her room. I
fear her ankle is badly sprained and she was much
shaken. She will regret not seeing you this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the squire, turning from the window,
&#8220;my little girl suffered more than was thought at the
time, but I hope she will be up in a few days. Meanwhile
you are to make &#8216;The Hall&#8217; your home. I&#8217;m
sure that you and Lawrence will find plenty with which
to amuse yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Squire Danesford; but I must go on.
I came out of my way for the sake of riding through
Pryndale and have already lost a day. I feared your
daughter was hurt more than she would admit. She
had an awful experience. I thought she would be
dashed to pieces before her horse could be stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of it, please. I haven&#8217;t slept for the
night. But, surely, your business isn&#8217;t so urgent that
you must away at once. I want to hear about your
mother. You know she and I lived on adjoining
plantations when we were children and were playmates.
Now, my boy, I want you to bring your
mother back to Pryndale. You should never have left
it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was leave or starve,&#8221; were the words on Rodney&#8217;s
tongue; but he did not speak them, and ever
after was glad that he hadn&#8217;t. Instead he said, &#8220;I will
tell her of your kind invitation. She was very fond
of her home here. You are very kind. Please give
my regards to Lisbeth and say that I regret not seeing
her and hope for her speedy recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, despite the squire&#8217;s urging that he remain,
Rodney set out on his journey home, less satisfied
with himself and the promises for his future than he
had been the night before.</p>
<p>The lad was, however, to have little time in the succeeding
months for reflections, pleasant or otherwise.
No sooner had he delivered the dispatches he was
carrying to Mr. Jefferson than he was off again on
similar missions.</p>
<p>In that early spring of 1775 Virginia was in a ferment.
Most of the leading men believed that war was
coming, and bent their energies to planning and so
shaping affairs that the colony might be ready for it.
Of this Rodney learned enough in his travels to appreciate
the gravity of the situation, and the importance
of vigilance and faithfulness on his part. He received
many compliments from his employer and deserved
them.</p>
<p>The position of those who favoured the king became
daily more unpleasant. Not only had they lost influence,
but were made to feel that they were marked
men, looked on by even their old neighbours with suspicion.
Soon they were to be called traitors to their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
faces and to know that their lives were in peril, for
always those may be found in times of excitement to
seek excuse for wreaking vengeance on enemies, doing
it in the name of the cause that is popular.</p>
<p>When the choleric royal governor, Lord Dunmore,
dissolved the House of Burgesses he accomplished
nothing save to increase the bitterness already existing.
The Virginia representatives met and chose delegates
to the General Congress to meet in Philadelphia, and
now Virginia was to have a convention of its own,
and hold it at Richmond, then a village of not more
than nine hundred white inhabitants, and there, in the
fire of his eloquence, Patrick Henry was to fuse the
differing views into one grand purpose and arouse the
people to the fact that war was indeed approaching.</p>
<p>Rodney Allison, whose duties, much to his delight,
had taken him to the convention, was one of the spectators
of that memorable scene when Patrick Henry
spoke. Ten years before, in the House of Burgesses,
Henry had told the awestruck delegates what he
thought of the infamous Stamp Act, and that, if what
he said were treason, they could make the most of it.
Now, he favoured raising volunteer soldiers in each
county, such as the Minute Men who had done such
valiant work in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The opposition to these resolutions aroused him, and
he rose to reply, and his words seared his views upon
the minds of the delegates, who sat motionless like
men in a trance. It seemed to Rodney, when the last
word was spoken, as though he had not breathed from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
the moment the orator began. The speaker&#8217;s face
seemed to become luminous and his eyes blazed and the
boy shivered as though with a chill. Certain of the
immortal sentences he never forgot and as they were
spoken he saw them in his excited imagination as
though written in letters of fire: &#8220;Suffer not yourselves
to be betrayed by a kiss,&#8221; referring to the king&#8217;s
promises. &#8220;In vain, after these things, may we
indulge the fond hope of reconciliation.&#8221; &#8220;There is no
longer any room for hope.&#8221; &#8220;The war is inevitable!
and let it come!&#8221; &#8220;The next gale
that sweeps from the North will bring to our ears the
clash of resounding arms!&#8221; At the close came those
words as from a prophet with a face of flame: &#8220;Give
me liberty or give me death!&#8221; and when he sat down
his listeners were ready to rise and declare war on the
instant.</p>
<p>Not all, for among those who heard were some who,
while they sat as though under a spell, nevertheless
were resolved past conversion to stand by their king.
Among them Rodney saw Squire Danesford elbowing
his way through the door, his face purple with rage,
and, once outside, he mounted his horse and rode away
at a mad gallop, followed by Black Tom.</p>
<p>The convention over, the delegates went to their
homes to make ready for the impending conflict. The
war spirit was abroad throughout the Old Dominion,
and young Allison found Nat unequal to the riding
he was required to do and was furnished with another
horse. Volunteers, with such arms as they could procure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
drilled daily and some among them were eager
for the fray to begin; but, when once it was begun,
not a few lost much of their ardour.</p>
<p>As Patrick Henry had predicted, the next gale
sweeping from the North was to bring to the waiting
ears of the Virginians the clash of resounding
arms, of the shots fired by the farmers in homespun
from behind stone walls and fences, all the way from
Lexington to Boston, into the ranks of panic-stricken
British soldiers. The day after that event, April 20th,
though before the news of Lexington reached Virginia,
the minute men of the Old Dominion were to shoulder
their guns in defiance of British authority.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>RALLYING VIRGINIA&#8217;S MINUTE MEN</h3>
</div>
<p>The evening after Rodney returned to Charlottesville,
Angus rode over on a raw-boned
steed that evidently had outlived his day for
leaping fences and following the hounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye think of him, Rod?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s some horse, looks like a blooded one,&#8221;
replied Rodney, speaking as favourably as he could,
for he liked Angus and knew the boy had been a little
envious of late. &#8220;Where did you get him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one Squire Herndon got down on the Pamunkey.
Reckon I made a good trade, fer I found he
was blind in one eye an&#8217; the squire took him fer a bad
debt an&#8217; already had more hosses than he could
feed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to trade him off and make a good
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t reckon I want to trade right away. I &#8217;low
after plantin&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ride round a bit. Thar&#8217;s
a heap o&#8217; things a feller can learn by travellin&#8217; around.
You know that.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so. Tell you what, Angus; I&#8217;ve got
to go to Williamsburg next week. Let&#8217;s go together.
I&#8217;ve never been there. It&#8217;s the capital of the Old
Dominion and, when the Burgesses are in session, one
can see more of the aristocracy in Williamsburg than
in any other place. Besides, the famous William and
Mary College is there. You know many of our greatest
men went there, the Byrds, the Lees and Randolphs,
and Thomas Jefferson, he was a student there. I&#8217;ve
heard that he would like to have a college right
here in Charlottesville run according to a plan of
his own. I&#8217;ll wager if he wants it he&#8217;ll get it if he
lives. Yes, we&#8217;ll ride down there and have a fine
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That we will fer sure, if we go. Reckon I can fix
it. Think we can see Patrick Henry? I want to see
him. They do say he can talk the birds right out o&#8217;
the trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never heard anything like it. He isn&#8217;t much
to look at, but when he speaks he can make the hair
in the back of your neck stand out straight like the ruff
of a cockerel in a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear the fellers talkin&#8217;. They&#8217;d march right to
Joppa if he&#8217;d lead &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s much of a soldier, but he surely
is an orator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angus rode home whistling.</p>
<p>That evening Mrs. Allison received the following
letter in which the reader may be interested, as was
Rodney:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Pryndale</span>, Va., March 28th, 1775.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Aunt Harriet</span>:&ndash;&ndash;I threw away my
crutches this morning, and tried to celebrate by dancing
a jig. I&#8217;m sure I should have succeeded to my
later sorrow but for Aunt Betty&#8217;s horrified look,
whereupon I sat down to write you instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawrence Enderwood thought Pryndale prosy and
I had begun to believe him when lo, two highwaymen
set upon us; a knight errant mounted on a splendid
steed rides to the rescue; Firefly takes fright and runs
away with a helpless maiden hanging by one foot to
the stirrup, and both hands in the mane, expecting
every moment to be dashed in pieces and actually
thinking of every wicked thing she ever did; my, but
it was an awful panorama! A snorting steed is heard
in pursuit, the knight errant spurs him on and seizes
the bridle of the running horse, rescues the hapless
maiden, who has discovered that she is so wicked she
wants to live, and then, <i>mirabile dictu!</i> the knight
errant is discovered to be no less a personage than one
Rodney Allison. Excuse me, Auntie, if I express the
opinion that you&#8217;ve not brought him up right; he&#8217;s
too shy and actually had to be urged to call on his old
playmate. Seriously, I would have seen him before he
fled, had I known he was there. Aunt Betty didn&#8217;t
tell me. You don&#8217;t know what a shock it was to papa
and me, the news Rodney brought of the death of
Uncle David. I turned my face to the wall and cried,
which as you may know I&#8217;m not in the habit of doing.
Not till after he had left Pryndale did I realize what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
I owed to him. He was much superior to any teacher
I had in London and he was so patient and kindly with
us, imps that we were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you left Pryndale things seem much changed
and for the worse. Papa is all out of sorts with what
he terms the disloyalty of the people. He insists we
are being driven into a wicked war by a few hot-headed
men together with those who are so ambitious
they would sacrifice their country. I wish I knew the
right of it. People who used to be friendly now look
the other way. Only the other day Gobber&#8217;s urchins
were playing by the road when I rode past their cabin
and the dirty imps made faces and cried out, &#8216;Tory,
I hate Tories.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next month papa and I are going to Philadelphia
and he may later sail for London. Somehow, it seems
to me as if I weren&#8217;t coming back. I suppose being
shut up in the house with my sprained ankle makes me
spleeny. Write me in the Quaker city, won&#8217;t you, and
address care of my uncle, Jacob Derwent. Now don&#8217;t
forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I know I have tired you already, so here&#8217;s
good-bye and my regards to Rodney, not forgetting
Nat, splendid fellow.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;Your affectionate niece,<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Elizabeth Danesford</span>.&#8221;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Rodney and Angus arrived at Williamsburg
April 19th, the very day the Massachusetts minute men
were hanging on the flanks of the running British like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
so many angry hornets. The following day, the minute
men of that part of Virginia were to be aroused by
a similar cause, the attempt of the representatives of
England to get possession of the colony&#8217;s powder.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that it was in the night that
the British troops sneaked out of Boston to go after
the powder stored at Concord. It was also in the night
that the royal governor, Lord Dunmore, secretly removed
the powder from the old arsenal in Williamsburg
and put it aboard the British vessel <i>Magdalen</i> in
the York River. The British in Boston didn&#8217;t get the
powder, but Dunmore&#8217;s men did, only there were but
fifteen half-barrels of it.</p>
<p>The population of Williamsburg at the time was
only about two thousand, and it must be remembered
that the country round about was not so thickly settled
as Massachusetts, consequently the minute men
couldn&#8217;t assemble so quickly; but there was buzzing
enough in the morning when it was discovered what
Lord Dunmore had done. The minute men of the
town were for marching to Dunmore&#8217;s house and seizing
him, but cooler heads prevailed.</p>
<p>The two boys had spent the previous day looking
over the capital and visiting the college at the other
end of the one long street, three quarters of a mile
distant. They lodged at the famous Raleigh Tavern,
which had sheltered the most prominent men of the
day, and so were right in the midst of the hubbub
when the excitement began. Out in the street they
watched the people assemble and listened to the talk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
When some one proposed marching on the &#8220;palace,&#8221; a
tipsy fellow cried out, &#8220;You jes&#8217; th&#8217; feller t&#8217; go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then when another bystander interfered and tried to
take him away, he began to struggle, and was being
roughly handled when a fat, pompous man bristled up,
saying, &#8220;Treat him kindly.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment the drunken man, swinging his
arms about wildly, struck the pompous man on the
head, knocking his old three-cornered hat into the dust.</p>
<p>The change in the fat philanthropist was marvellous,
for he jumped up and down crying, &#8220;Kill him, kill
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd laughed. A man came running toward
them saying, &#8220;They&#8217;ve sent for Patrick Henry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see him, after all,&#8221; exclaimed Angus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a message for him, so we had better ride
to his home in New Castle. We may meet him,&#8221;
Rodney replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see him and I want to see the fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to keep your cake and eat it too,&#8221; replied
Rodney.</p>
<p>Just then a report spread through the crowd that
Dunmore had seized the powder for the purpose of
sending it to another county where he feared there
would be an uprising of the blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re likely to have one of our own,&#8221; exclaimed a
bystander.</p>
<p>An old woman, somewhat deaf, cried, &#8220;The blacks
are risin&#8217;! I knowed it. I didn&#8217;t dream of snakes fer
nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If I had your imagination, Granny Snodgrass, I&#8217;d
make molasses taffy out o&#8217; moonshine,&#8221; remarked a
pert miss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me, Angus, as though these people were
going to do their fighting with their tongues,&#8221; said
Rodney. &#8220;So let&#8217;s get away to New Castle.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached New Castle, late the next day,
they found Mr. Henry busy assembling the volunteers
for a march on Williamsburg to demand return of the
powder, also to see to it that Dunmore did not take
the money in the colonial treasury. These men were
called &#8220;gentlemen independents of Hanover,&#8221; and they
were manly looking, resolute men, and well armed.
By the time they had reached Doncaster&#8217;s, within
sixteen miles of Williamsburg, their number was increased
to one hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunmore will wish he hadn&#8217;t when he&#8217;s seen &#8217;em,&#8221;
remarked Angus.</p>
<p>Dunmore was frightened before he saw them and
sent Corbin, the receiver general, to meet them and
make terms with them, which he did, paying three
hundred and thirty pounds for the powder, surely all
it was worth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve concluded, Angus,&#8221; said Rodney, &#8220;from what
I can see and hear, that Mr. Henry hasn&#8217;t cared so
much about the powder as he does for an excuse to
rouse the country, get the men together and encourage
them by backing Lord Dunmore down,&#8221; all of which
indicated that the lad had become a shrewd observer.</p>
<p>After the powder was paid for, Patrick Henry, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
was a delegate to the Colonial Congress, set out for
Philadelphia. Lord Dunmore, however, had been
badly frightened, and he issued a proclamation against
him, and declared that if the people didn&#8217;t behave he
would offer freedom to the negroes and burn the town;
he also had cannon placed around his house, proceedings
which, it is easy to understand, made the
citizens very angry.</p>
<p>The boys returned to Charlottesville and Angus
immediately joined a company of volunteers, declaring
if there was to be a war he was going.</p>
<p>By this time they had heard the news of the battle
of Lexington, brought all the way from Boston by
mounted messengers riding by relays.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means war,&#8221; Rodney remarked to his mother.
How he wanted to go, to do as Angus had done and
join the volunteers! But he hadn&#8217;t the heart to propose
it after seeing the look which came into his
mother&#8217;s face. It sometimes happens, however, that
war comes to those who do not go to war, and so it
happened to Rodney Allison.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>VIRGINIANS LEARNING TO SHOOT BRITISH TROOPS</h3>
</div>
<p>Rodney&#8217;s duties took him to Philadelphia
during the Continental Congress. There he
saw Washington, a delegate from Virginia
and clad in his uniform, for he knew war must come,
and that warlike dress proclaimed his belief more
loudly than his voice. There also were the Adamses,
from Massachusetts, Samuel and John, the latter a
wise, shrewd organizer determined to have all the
colonies, especially the southern, committed to the
revolution he saw approaching. In this effort he used
his influence, not for John Hancock of Massachusetts,
who coveted the place of commander-in-chief, but for
George Washington, who the day after the battle of
Bunker Hill was chosen and modestly accepted with
the proviso that he should receive no pay for his services.
There, also, came Benjamin Franklin, just returned
from England and convinced nothing remained
but war; and there, too, was Jefferson, likewise certain
the time had come for the colonies to declare their
independence of England.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>Rodney&#8217;s boyish prejudices were in favour of everything
Jefferson did, and he was impatient with those,
and they were the greater number, who wished to
delay decisive action in the hope of conciliation. This
prejudice extended to the Quakers in their broad-brimmed
hats, nearly all of whom were opposed to war.</p>
<p>Boys are usually impatient, unable to work and wait
and keep working, as the wise men of that Congress
were doing.</p>
<p>The boy had but part of two days in the city, which
was the first he had seen and consequently full of
interest; so he did not call on Lisbeth, indeed, had
there been plenty of time he would have hesitated in
his rough dress of homespun to have presented himself
before her aristocratic friends.</p>
<p>The day he turned Nat&#8217;s nose in the direction of
Virginia a young man rode alongside and said, &#8220;Why,
this is an unexpected pleasure, if as I suspect, you are
on your way home.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was Lawrence Enderwood. Rodney&#8217;s reply was
almost surly, as several reasons for Enderwood&#8217;s
presence in Philadelphia flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going directly home but by way of Williamsburg.
I live in Albemarle County.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I, too, am riding by way of Williamsburg, and if
you have no objections to my company should be
delighted to join you. It is a long ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney could offer no objections, indeed, as they
went on, he found his companion a very agreeable
one, notwithstanding that in course of the conversation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
it appeared that Lawrence had seen Lisbeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very gay, seems to be absorbed in the
gaieties and social life so that she has little time for
anything else.&#8221; Somehow this remark of Enderwood,
spoken rather impatiently, afforded Rodney a little
comfort, though he hardly could have explained it.</p>
<p>On arriving at Williamsburg, they found the little
town well filled, for Governor Dunmore had convened
the House of Burgesses to listen to Lord North&#8217;s plans
for conciliation.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed by a kiss,&#8217;&#8221;
quoted Rodney, and Lawrence laughingly replied,
&#8220;Patrick Henry has a way of saying things so the
people remember them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager they remember that and turn Lord
North down with a slam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s evident to me you are for war, Rodney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, er&ndash;&ndash;I suppose I am, but it isn&#8217;t pleasant to
think of losing one&#8217;s estate if not his neck, all of which
is possible. The business men of Philadelphia are
pretty long-headed, and most of them believe England
will win in the end and that the war will be most
destructive of property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely Washington and Jefferson have estates to
lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I reckon we&#8217;re in for it, and my father says
when there&#8217;s something to do, do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As was expected, the House of Burgesses would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
have nothing to do with the kind of conciliation proposed.
The people were restless and Dunmore, fearing
them, left his &#8220;palace&#8221; and went aboard a British
vessel and ordered that the bills be sent to him for
signature. He was politely informed that if he signed
them he would have to return, which he did not do.
Then the Burgesses adjourned to October, appointing
a permanent committee to have charge of colonial
affairs, and that committee appointed Patrick Henry
to command of the colonial troops.</p>
<p>Rodney&#8217;s visits to Charlottesville were brief and it
seemed that his absence worried his mother. The latter
part of October he was sent to Norfolk, where
Dunmore proposed to establish his headquarters. As
it happened, he fell in with the troops which Colonel
Woodford had been ordered to lead to the relief of
the village of Hampton, and was present at the attack
on the place and took part in the defence.</p>
<p>In this encounter the marksmanship of the Virginians
decided the matter, for, when the ships
approached the town and commenced to bombard it,
the riflemen picked off the gunners and drove them
from their cannon and then, when they tried to work
their sails so as to escape, the Virginians shot them
out of the rigging. Although the town was damaged
by the bombardment, the defenders escaped serious
injury, though the sensations of being under fire
afforded many of the defenders their first taste of war.</p>
<p>On leaving Lawrence Enderwood, the previous summer,
Rodney had promised to pay him a visit at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
first opportunity. Indeed, mutual liking had resulted
from their journey from Philadelphia. Here was the
opportunity, and young Allison accepted it.</p>
<p>He found Lawrence at home, managing the plantation
in the absence of his father in England. It was a
delightful old place, having been in the Enderwood
family for four generations. The house reminded
him of &#8220;The Hall&#8221; and, being a privileged guest, he
enjoyed all the luxuries which the old Virginia plantation
could afford. He rode after the hounds, Nat
acquitting himself so well that Lawrence offered a
round sum for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d sell my shirt from my back before I would
that horse,&#8221; Rodney replied.</p>
<p>There was good shooting, and Allison excelled his
host. His training with the Indians stood him in good
stead. He made a bow and arrows for Lawrence&#8217;s
younger brother, such as Ahneota, himself, would have
approved, and when it came time for him to depart
he was sorry to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be ructions over Norfolk way and I&#8217;m
going to ride over with you,&#8221; said Lawrence, the
morning Rodney was making preparations for leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good news and makes it less hard for me
to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>They set out about eight in the morning. The sunshine
was brilliant and the air cool and invigorating.
Here and there in the landscape were faint bits of
green untouched by the frost. As they rode along they
learned that the people were almost in a panic, fearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
Dunmore&#8217;s marauders, who had been pillaging and
burning in the county below.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man is only arousing the people and accomplishing
no good,&#8221; said Lawrence. &#8220;He declares he
will rule the colony and at the same time induces the
negroes to revolt. That very act drives every Virginian,
not under British protection, into the ranks of
the so-called rebels. They realize that, while the
negroes won&#8217;t do any effective fighting, they may, in a
fury of resentment, cause great damage and imperil
the lives of hundreds of families.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the poor governors England has sent over
here have had much to do with the colonies&#8217; rebelling.
Hark! I hear horses at the gallop.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, nearly a dozen mounted men, several
of them in British uniforms, came around the corner
about sixty rods behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunmore&#8217;s marauders!&#8221; exclaimed Lawrence.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their horses had both speed and &#8220;bottom&#8221; and
besides were fresh, so that the chances were in favour
of the young Virginians. The troopers behind spurred
after them, however, and evidently were determined on
their capture.</p>
<p>As Lawrence and Rodney approached a plantation
near the road, they saw flames leap up from the hay
ricks, and the next instant two mounted men rode out
on the main highway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are Britishers, sent ahead,&#8221; exclaimed Lawrence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing for us but to go ahead,&#8221; said
Rodney, passing one of his two pistols over to
Lawrence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you to the finish,&#8221; replied the latter, his
face very grim and determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; cried one of the marauders, who waved a
sword as if to enforce his authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of the way. We are on our own business!&#8221;
cried Rodney.</p>
<p>The second marauder lifted his pistol, but Rodney
anticipated him with a quick shot which brought the
man&#8217;s arm down, while the pistol clattered to the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lucky shot,&#8221; thought the boy.</p>
<p>His companion was not so lucky; he had fired and
missed his opponent, who rode forward with drawn
sword evidently resolved on cutting him down.</p>
<p>Rodney seized his pistol by the barrel and hurled it
straight for the trooper&#8217;s head and hit the mark
squarely, the man pitching out of his saddle like a log!
Not in vain had been those hours the boy had spent
with Conrad learning to throw the tomahawk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy you the finest pistols in Norfolk if we ever
get there,&#8221; said Lawrence, thus expressing the gratitude
he felt.</p>
<p>Having distanced their pursuers, the remainder of
their journey was without incident; but from report of
conditions in Norfolk, where Dunmore had seized Mr.
Holt&#8217;s printing press and was enforcing martial law so
far as he could, they decided it was not a safe place for
them to visit and turned aside to join the volunteers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
they heard were approaching under command of
Colonel Woodford, who had done such good service
at Hampton.</p>
<p>Dunmore also had heard of the approach of the
Culpeper men, and resolved to keep them at a distance
from Norfolk.</p>
<p>Knowing that they would have to cross what was
known as Great Bridge, about nine miles from Norfolk,
he forwarded troops under Captains Fordyce and
Leslie to check the Virginians at the bridge.</p>
<p>The British had thrown up earthworks at the Norfolk
end of the bridge when the Americans arrived.
The latter built an entrenchment at their end of the
bridge. Lieutenant Travis with nearly one hundred
men occupied this, while Woodford, with the remainder
of the Virginian forces, was stationed at a church
about four hundred yards distant, when the British
came across the bridge to make an attack. The British
fired as they approached, while their two field pieces in
the rear kept up a cannonade.</p>
<p>Travis ordered his men to withhold their fire until
the enemy should almost reach the entrenchments.
Captain Fordyce took this to mean that the Americans
had deserted the breastworks and waved his hat in
anticipation of victory. Then the Americans, who had
been lying down, rose and poured a deadly fire into
the ranks of the enemy, and Fordyce was among the
first to fall.</p>
<p>Captain Leslie now came to the support of Fordyce&#8217;s
men, and Colonel Woodford led his men forward to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
support Travis, while Colonel Stevens led a body of
men, with whom were Enderwood and Allison, to
attack the British on the flank.</p>
<p>For a few minutes the skirmish was hot. The
British fought doggedly, as many believed what Dunmore
had told them, that if captured the Virginians
would scalp them. Rodney received a light flesh
wound, but most of the Americans escaped uninjured,
while several of the enemy were killed.</p>
<p>All this seems very tame in the telling, but to those
who took part in the engagement it was most exciting
and the Americans were jubilant, for they had met the
British troops and driven them!</p>
<p>For several days reinforcements poured in from the
different parts of Virginia, and five days later Colonel
Woodford marched his men to Norfolk.</p>
<p>Lord Dunmore decided he could not oppose him, so
withdrew aboard his ships.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are the pistols,&#8221; said Lawrence the next day,
presenting Rodney with a handsome pair with silver
mounted handles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; they are beauties. I hope you bought
a brace of them for yourself as well. You are likely to
need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following day both left for their homes, parting
the best of friends and planning to meet again.</p>
<p>As for Dunmore, his career in America was drawing
to a close, though he was able to do more mischief.</p>
<p>Provisions getting scarce, and the riflemen in the
city annoying the British, he sent word that unless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
this firing was stopped and provisions furnished he
would burn the town. His threat was defied and, on
another ship joining Dunmore, he sent a force ashore
to start a conflagration. In this way much of the
thriving town of nearly six thousand inhabitants was
burned; what buildings escaped were burned later by
the Americans to prevent their occupation by the
British.</p>
<p>Later, Dunmore left and established barracks on
Gwyn&#8217;s Island in Chesapeake Bay, whence he was
driven the following July by that grim old fighter,
General Andrew Lewis, who had wanted to fight him
out on the Pickaway Plains, during the Indian war.</p>
<p>When Rodney reached Charlottesville he found his
mother sick with fever. Without hesitation he gave
up his employment and remained to care for her. For
many months she was almost helpless.</p>
<p>The change from the excitement of his previous
occupation to the monotony of home&ndash;&ndash;Angus had
joined the army&ndash;&ndash;sorely tried Rodney&#8217;s patience.</p>
<p>The previous summer Morgan had marched his
riflemen to Boston and soon it was reported that, under
Benedict Arnold, he had gone by way of the Kennebec
River, to attack Quebec. Since then nothing had been
learned of him and his gallant men.</p>
<p>General Washington was trying to make an army
out of the mob of patriots he found awaiting him
outside Boston, but as yet it did not appear that any
headway was being made toward dislodging the
British from the town.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>Spring came and with it report of the evacuation of
Boston; then news of the defeat of the Americans in
Canada. Morgan had been captured and was a
prisoner within the walls of Quebec. Later, tidings
came of Washington&#8217;s march on New York.</p>
<p>May 6, 1776, one hundred and thirty of the representative
men of the Old Dominion, in convention
assembled, declared that the king and Parliament had
disregarded the constitution of the colony, which
accordingly was free to exercise such independence as
it might be able to maintain. Nine days later they
instructed the colony&#8217;s delegates in the Continental
Congress to vote for independence, and the flag of
England fluttered down from the capitol building. By
doing these things every one of them exposed his neck
to the British halter; but they were virile men, who
had arrived at the parting of the ways.</p>
<p>A few weeks later the Declaration of Independence,
written by Thomas Jefferson, was proclaimed throughout
the land amid great rejoicing. Then the country
settled down to its grim task. What a task it was!
Many times it seemed that the poor, thinly populated
land might endure no longer. England was a very
powerful foe, feared throughout the world. Not all
Americans were patriots. Some were Tories on principle,
others for gain. Very many were selfish and
not a few corrupt; but enough so loved their country
and independence as to endure and struggle unto the
glorious end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>RODNEY&#8217;S SACRIFICE AND HIS MOTHER&#8217;S</h3>
</div>
<p>One midsummer day Rodney Allison walked
along the dusty road. He did not carry his
head erect as usual but seemed to be pondering
over some problem.</p>
<p>He was a &#8220;strapping,&#8221; fine looking lad, almost a
man grown, and in experience already a man. He
stopped before a little gate opening into a pasture and
gave three shrill whistles. Over the top of a ridge two
pointed ears appeared, poised for an instant, and then
their owner galloped into view.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a beauty you are, Nat,&#8221; said the boy, as if
talking to himself, stretching out his hand to stroke
the silky nose that was thrust over the fence.</p>
<p>The two standing together formed a picture to
afford delight so long as the eye shall admire grace,
breeding and power. The boy&#8217;s figure was erect, his
wavy hair hanging gracefully to his broad shoulders.
His face, while not handsome, was clear cut, resolute
and showed lines of character not usually graven in the
face of one as young. His dark gray eyes always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
looked at one steadily. Now they were darker than
usual and had in them the shadow of trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat, how would you like to change masters?&#8221;</p>
<p>The colt nuzzled the boy&#8217;s face and then his
pockets, in one of which he found the nubbin of corn
he sought.</p>
<p>&#8220;You rascal, all you care about having is a good
commissary. You won&#8217;t miss me, will you? Oh, no!
I&#8217;d thought we&#8217;d go to the war together. We would
have something worth fighting for, a free country,
where a man wouldn&#8217;t need to have dukes for uncles
in order to be of some consequence in the world. We
would show &#8217;em, you and I, that horses and boys
raised in this country are as good as the best; but that
can&#8217;t be. You are too good a horse to drag the plow
on this poor little farm. You shall have one of the
greatest men in this great land for a master, while I
will stay away from the war and both of us may save
our precious skins and perhaps be British subjects in
the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nat&#8217;s purplish eyes seemed full of comprehension,
as he mumbled the lad&#8217;s hand with his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horses seem to know more of some things than
they really do, and know more of some other
things than they seem to; how&#8217;s that for horse sense,
Nathaniel Bacon Allison?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nat blinked, but shed no tears. Rodney blinked and
his eyes were wet. The boy opened the gate and the
colt followed him to the stable, where he was saddled
and ridden to Monticello.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>As Rodney left the manager of Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s
estate he said: &#8220;I only ask that you say to Mr.
Jefferson, I sell the colt with the understanding that
I may buy him back if I ever get the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, an&#8217; you won&#8217;t need it in writin&#8217; so long
as Mr. Jefferson lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a long, dusty, gloomy road was that over
which the boy walked back to his home!</p>
<p>&#8220;What has become of Nat?&#8221; his mother asked, a
few days later. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was too valuable a horse for me to own and I
sold him to Mr. Jefferson. I can have the privilege of
buying him back,&#8221; and Rodney turned away, afraid to
trust himself to say more.</p>
<p>The crops that fall were successful and the neighbours
told the boy he would surely make a good
farmer. He worked early and late and grew strong;
whereas his mother, watching him with sad eyes,
became weaker.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Allison was absorbed in thought the old
coloured woman would stand looking with anxious
face at her mistress. One day she said, &#8220;Missus, yo&#8217;
jes&#8217; done git well. Dat&#8217;s no mo&#8217;n doin&#8217; what&#8217;s right by
Marse Rodney, ah reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Allison looked up into the kindly old face of
the coloured woman, and a wan smile was on her lips
as she replied, &#8220;Mam, you are a woman of good sense,
and, God willing, I will get well.&#8221; From that day she
began to improve.</p>
<p>Angus being away, Rodney had little diversion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>His chief pastime now was target practice with the
rifle. The old Indian had chosen wisely when he
purchased the rifle, and the boy became very proficient
in marksmanship. One day when he had made a fine
shot he turned and found his mother and the two
servants watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t an idea you were such a fine shot, Rodney,&#8221;
said his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scolding Squaw hasn&#8217;t an equal in the whole
county of Albemarle, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lan&#8217; sakes, an&#8217; what heathen mought she be?&#8221;
asked Mam.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was once the rifle of a noted chief of the
Wyandottes, and when she speaks a deadly silence
follows,&#8221; replied the boy, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marse Rodney will be wantin&#8217; ter jine de riflemen,
I specs,&#8221; remarked Thello.</p>
<p>Mam, noting her mistress&#8217; face, hastened to say,
&#8220;Reckon de riflemen done froze up in Canada las&#8217;
winter. Dey won&#8217;t be rantin&#8217; down in ol&#8217; Virginny
fer one right smart spell.&#8221;</p>
<p>That year, 1776, there were no steel rails laid nor
copper wires strung to carry the news, yet it was surprising
how quickly tidings of victory and defeat
spread over the country.</p>
<p>Charlottesville was a very small town out near the
shadows of the Blue Ridge mountains, yet its people,
not many weeks after the events occurred, had heard
how Donald McDonald had led the Scotch Tories of
North Carolina against the rifles of the Whigs and how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
the rifles proved more powerful than the Scottish
broadswords; then had come the joyful news that
Commodore Parker and his forty ships had sailed away
from Charleston, South Carolina, which they had come
to capture as though the doing of it were the pastime
of a summer&#8217;s holiday. Between them and the town
they had found a little island and on it a small fort
built of soft palmetto logs bedded in sand and defended
by a few daring men under the gallant Moultrie.
These brave fellows could shoot cannon as straight as
could the North Carolina Whigs their rifles. Later,
even among the hamlets along the frontier, the cheers
rang out when it was learned that Congress had finally
approved the Declaration of Independence, and aid
was now expected from France!</p>
<p>Not all the news was encouraging. Washington had
known that, unless granted men and supplies, he could
not hold New York against the British. Congress had
insisted that he make the attempt, but gave him no
assistance. He had failed, and barely kept the greater
part of the American army out of British clutches.
The king had succeeded in hiring Hessians, some
twenty thousand of them, to fight England&#8217;s battles
in America, with the promise of all the loot they could
secure. France was very slow in granting aid, uncertain
as yet how much resistance America might be
able to make. The attempt to capture Quebec had
failed, and the Americans were chased out of Canada.
Washington had been unable to keep an effective army
together as Congress would provide only for short
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
terms of enlistment, and little money or supplies for
the troops. Men who had shouted for freedom were
now despondent, and some of them were going over
to the enemy, which occupied New York and most of
New Jersey and had concluded the war was about
ended.</p>
<p>In September Morgan came back from Quebec, but
under parole. He had been offered great inducements
to fight with England, but scorned them as an insult
to his manhood. If he could be released from parole
he would do loyal service for his country. Arnold had
fought desperately around Lake Champlain with the
remnants of the troops driven from Canada, but the
odds against him were too great. Washington, alone,
was the nucleus around which the hopes of America
centred, but he could accomplish little except to hold
positions between the British and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Winter came on and the situation grew worse. Congress
became frightened and made ludicrous haste to
vote all sorts of assistance to Washington, after it
was too late for him to use it for striking an effective
blow.</p>
<p>It was evident that Rodney brooded over the long
series of failures, but he still stoutly insisted, &#8220;It&#8217;s not
Washington&#8217;s fault, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, just after New Year&#8217;s, 1777, report came
that Washington, with his ragged troops, had crossed
the Delaware amid the floating ice, and marched
almost barefooted to Trenton in a howling snowstorm,
and there had defeated the Hessians, Rodney fairly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
shouted in his joy, &#8220;I knew he&#8217;d do it, I knew he&#8217;d
do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>About a month later, Angus came home. He was a
sorry looking Angus, what with a severe wound, and
his ragged regimentals, and his feet bound up in rags.
But he was a very important Angus, withal, for had
he not crossed the Delaware with Washington; had
he not left bloody footprints on the snowy road to
Trenton; had he not charged down King Street, swept
by the northeast gale and British lead, and driven the
brutal Hessians as chaff is swept before the wind? He
was, to the village folk, the returned conqueror, and
much they made of him, the Allisons with the others.
He no longer envied Rodney mounted on Nat riding
over the country with all the importance of a special
messenger, and it is to be hoped that Rodney did not
envy him, now that conditions seemed reversed. To
young Allison&#8217;s credit be it said that, if in his heart lay
a smouldering spark of envy, it did not show itself.</p>
<p>When Angus was able to go about, he frequently
visited the Allison home, and revelled in narrations of
his experiences. He, like the common people generally,
regarded Washington as an idol. He delighted
in descriptions of the appearance of his beloved general
at the crossing of the Delaware; again at the
battle of Princeton, when Washington had ridden out
directly between the lines of the British and the
wavering Americans he sought to encourage, sitting
like a statue on his big horse, while the bullets of
friends and foes flew about him, and then riding away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
unscathed, as though by a miracle. The lad&#8217;s enthusiasm
made it all seem very real, even when he told
how, one winter morning, the general walked about
among his men while wearing a strip of red flannel
tied about his throat because of a cold, and picked up
with one hand a piece of heavy baggage, that would
have burdened both arms of an ordinary man, and
lightly tossed it on top of a baggage wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had but twenty-four hundred men to capture
Trenton, an&#8217; all the other generals who were to help
him failed. I was right close to him when the messenger
rode up to tell him Cadwalader couldn&#8217;t git
across the river, an&#8217; I heard him say &#8216;I am determined
to cross the river and attack Trenton in the morning.&#8217;
I tell ye thar was no fellers who heard him but would
hev follered him on their knees, bein&#8217; they couldn&#8217;t
hev used their feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The British thought the war ended before they
lost Trenton, I hear,&#8221; said Mrs. Allison, her eyes
shining, for one of her ancestors had ridden with
Nathaniel Bacon, the Virginian rebel, when there was
British tyranny in the Old Dominion.</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt of it; why, all of us in the army
reckoned how the war couldn&#8217;t last much longer. We
hadn&#8217;t rations nor clothes; the men were goin&#8217; home
when their time was up an&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t enlist again. We
heard that Cornwallis was goin&#8217; home to tell the king
how he&#8217;d licked us, an&#8217; old Howe was gamblin&#8217; an&#8217;
guzzlin&#8217; in New York, spendin&#8217; his prize money like
water. Oh, they thought they had us licked for sure!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
Long&#8217;s Washington lives they can&#8217;t lick us nohow,
though they&#8217;ve got over thirty thousand men an&#8217;
plenty o&#8217; money, an&#8217; we with neither. But the soldiers
are &#8217;lowin&#8217; as how France will help us. Benjamin
Franklin is over there an&#8217; they say he has a way o&#8217;
gittin&#8217; what he goes after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it was Doctor Franklin&#8217;s &#8216;Poor Richard&#8217;
who said, &#8216;God helps those who help themselves.&#8217;
We&#8217;ve got to rely on ourselves,&#8221; Mrs. Allison said, as
if speaking to herself, but all the while looking at
Rodney.</p>
<p>He did not notice this, for he sat gazing into the
fire, saying little, though no word of Angus escaped
him. Finally, looking up and addressing his mother,
he said, &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it Mr. Mason who said he did not
wish to survive the liberties of his country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; she replied, adding, &#8220;but we say
things in time of excitement which are pretty hard to
live up to,&#8221; and turned away.</p>
<p>Rodney had secured quite profitable employment
that winter. His mother&#8217;s health had improved, and
the lad could hear the clatter of her loom through the
open window one warm morning in early March when
a passing horseman brought the news that &#8220;Dan
Morgan was having hard work to raise a body of riflemen.&#8221;
He had been appointed a colonel the previous
fall, and, as soon as he was released from his parole,
began to enlist men to go to the assistance of Washington
at Morristown.</p>
<p>The man talked loudly, and the noise of the loom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
ceased while Mrs. Allison listened. After supper that
evening she said, &#8220;I hear that Colonel Morgan, of
whom you have told me so much, is enlisting men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother, and there is no finer man for a leader
than he, unless it is Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought, since Angus came home, that you
were wishing you might enter the service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney looked up quickly. &#8220;Why, if I could get
away I&#8217;d like to go, but I&ndash;&ndash;my duty is at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am well, now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and affairs are in such
condition I think we can care for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;no, I ought not to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, you have my permission, indeed I&#8217;m not
sure but it is your duty to give your service, your
young life perhaps, to the cause of liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney sprang up, his face aflame with eagerness.
&#8220;Do you mean it, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one must fight our battles if we are to win.
Your father is not here to go to the front, as he would
have done had he lived, and&ndash;&ndash;and I feel sure he
would like to have the house of Allison represented in
a cause he had so much at heart, and I&#8217;m afraid I
should make a poor soldier, Rodney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, you are braver than any soldier who ever
went to war!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it happened that the following Monday,
dressed in the homespun of his mother&#8217;s loom and
carrying the rifle he had taken from the lodge of the
Wyandotte chieftain, Rodney Allison left for Winchester
to join Morgan&#8217;s command.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>IN THE THICK OF IT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Can ye shoot straight an&#8217; often, travel light,
starve an&#8217; yet fight on an empty stomach?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some experience at that sort of
thing, Colonel Morgan, and think I can be of service
in your command.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have I seen you? Yer face looks familiar.
I have it, your name is Allison an&#8217; you were the little
feller as showed me the way to the rear of the redskins
the day they ambushed Wood out in the Ohio country.
Want ye, I reckon I do! I want five hundred like ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus it was that Rodney found welcome when
he presented himself to Morgan at Winchester, and
the welcome was so hearty that it helped put the boy
on friendly footing with his fellows at the start.</p>
<p>The march to Morristown was not very pleasant
owing to the bad condition of the roads. On the way
recruits joined them so that on the first of April, when
they reached Washington&#8217;s headquarters, they numbered
about one hundred and eighty men, considerably
less than the five hundred wanted.</p>
<p>One of the recruits who joined them on the march
was a young man whose reception by Morgan attracted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
general attention, it was so cordial. He was a
straight, sinewy fellow with shrewd, kindly gray eyes
and &#8220;sandy&#8221; hair. He was clad like a frontiersman
and the moment the colonel saw him he exclaimed,
&#8220;By all that&#8217;s good an&#8217; glorious, Zeb, I&#8217;ve seen ye in
my dreams followin&#8217; me up the ladder at the barrier,
but I never expected to see ye in the flesh again.
Where&#8217;s yer Fidus&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s his name, that Lovell
boy?&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I left him in Boston after the evacuation, an&#8217;
haven&#8217;t heard from him since. How are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never so well in my life. Prison fare up in old
Quebec agreed with me, I reckon. Boys,&#8221; he said,
turning to a knot of his men who had gathered about,
&#8220;this man Zeb, an&#8217; a Boston boy, brought up the rear
on that march to Quebec. It was the hardest thing I
ever did when I detailed &#8217;em for the duty. How they
got through alive I never could understand. And
young Allison, here, is a chap as was with me fightin&#8217;
Indians out in the Ohio country. I wish all the boys
who&#8217;ve marched with me could fall into the ranks
to-day; we&#8217;d keep right on to New York an&#8217; capture
Howe, bag an&#8217; baggage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we take New York,&#8221; laughed Zeb, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
need more men than Congress ever has got together,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;. I was there when Washington tried to
hold it, because Congress an&#8217; the country expected him
to do the impossible. But, Colonel, I will say as how
if you led the way, thar&#8217;d not be one of &#8217;em, as ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
marched with Morgan, who wouldn&#8217;t be at yer
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I like that kind of talk. Meanwhile we&#8217;ll
get the kinks out of our legs marching to Morristown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are an Injun fighter,&#8221; remarked Zeb to
Rodney, as they fell into line side by side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarcely that,&#8221; replied Rodney, flushing with
pleasure as he thought of the introduction by his
colonel. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been made prisoner by them, lived with
them for a time and ran away from &#8217;em, doing a little
fighting by the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, the colonel appears to like ye, an&#8217; that&#8217;s a
recommendation not to be sneezed at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I can keep his good will. I never saw a
man whose men were more loyal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a lion in a fight, asks no man to go whar he
won&#8217;t go himself. And he knows what the boys are
thinkin&#8217; about, an&#8217; just how to manage &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told that on the march to the Scioto one of
his men disobeyed orders, in fact had been disgruntled
for some time, and that Morgan walked up to him and
said, &#8216;Come with me a minute.&#8217; They went into the
woods together and, when they came back, the man
had a black eye and looked as though he&#8217;d stolen a
sheep; but ever after he didn&#8217;t have to be told twice to
do a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeb laughed, saying, &#8220;That sort of treatment was
what that kind of man could understand. But Morgan
never allowed one of his men to be flogged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was terribly flogged once himself.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but he was too much of a man for that to
break him, though the ordinary man who&#8217;s been
whipped seems to lose his self respect and his courage,
an&#8217; Morgan won&#8217;t allow it in his command.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time Morgan&#8217;s men arrived at Morristown,
Zeb and Rodney were the best of friends, and the
latter had heard the story of the expedition to Quebec,<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
of Donald Lovell and what a fine lad he was, until he
hoped that Zeb&#8217;s wish, that they meet him, might be
granted.</p>
<p>It was a very small army which Morgan found at
Morristown. Of the sixteen regiments Congress had
requested the colonies to furnish (Congress could do
little but request), not over six hundred men had
arrived. The next two months were passed in recruiting
the army and getting it into condition, a very
trying time to the many impatient spirits in Morgan&#8217;s
command, and doubtless very trying also to their
commander, who always chafed under any sort of
inaction. What with target practice and drilling, all
were kept out of mischief, however, and Rodney found
that as a marksman he could &#8220;hold his own&#8221; with the
best.</p>
<p>Zeb, who had become his daily companion, received
in May a letter from his old friend, Donald Lovell, who
wrote that he had fully recovered from a wound he
had received in the battle on Long Island the year
before, and hoped soon to get back into the service.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>A corps, called Morgan&#8217;s Rangers, was made up of
men picked from the various regiments, five hundred
in all. There were, among them, Virginians, Pennsylvania
&#8220;Dutchmen,&#8221; men from the Carolinas, men
from the frontier and Yankees. Skill in the use of the
rifle was a necessary qualification for membership.
They were a fine lot of men for the perilous duties to
which they were to be assigned.</p>
<p>The corps was divided into eight companies, the
captains of which were: Cobel, Posey, Knox, Long,
Swearingen, Parr, Boone, and Henderson, all men
selected by Morgan.</p>
<p>The organization of this corps was completed on
June 13th, on which day it was ordered by Washington
to watch for the approach of British scouting parties,
for it was learned that Howe was to begin active operations.
The American headquarters had now been
changed to Middlebrook. That very day two divisions
of the British forces, one under Cornwallis and the
other under DeHeister, set out from New Brunswick
for the purpose of engaging Washington, confident
that, with a little more fighting, they would crush the
revolution.</p>
<p>The Rangers had their first glimpse of the British
under Cornwallis when the latter reached Somerset
Court House, and, for several days, there was sharp
skirmishing with scouting parties.</p>
<p>Rodney and Zeb were stationed one afternoon on
one of the roads as pickets, when a company of the
British were discovered approaching. The pickets&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
orders were to fire and fall back on the main body,
unless it should be thought possible, in case of a small
number of the enemy, to report their presence and
secure force enough to cut them off. This was the
view taken both by Zeb and his companion, so they
ran back to report.</p>
<p>A squad of the Rangers was hurried forward to
meet the enemy, with instructions to get between them
and their main army, and make them prisoners.
Before this could be accomplished the British came
upon them. The enemy outnumbered the Rangers two
to one, yet the latter would have charged them but for
orders to halt and fire. So quickly was the order
obeyed that the crack of their rifles rang out together
with the British officer&#8217;s command to fire. The British
fired blindly into the smoke, whereas the riflemen had
taken quick, accurate aim. But one among the
Rangers was hit, and that was Rodney, he receiving a
slight flesh wound in the left arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought a bee had stung me,&#8221; he said, later,
when Zeb discovered the blood on his friend&#8217;s sleeve.</p>
<p>The enemy, being uncertain as to the number of the
Rangers, fell back in good order, carrying their dead
with them. They were pursued by the Rangers until a
larger body met them, when the Americans retreated.</p>
<p>Skirmishes like this were of daily occurrence, and
Cornwallis, finding that Washington was not disposed
to accommodate him by rashly engaging in battle under
disadvantageous conditions, retreated to New Brunswick,
with the Rangers dogging his flanks.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>Quite a number of deserters were picked up. Benjamin
Franklin had devised a shrewd scheme for
encouraging desertions. Learning the brand of tobacco
specially liked by the Hessians, he had offers
concealed in packages of this tobacco, which was distributed
where the Hessians would get them. These
hired troops had no love for the cause for which they
were fighting, and many of them had little for the
tyranny with which they were treated when at home in
Germany. When they read these offers, printed in
German, of money and land, they were sorely tempted
to change masters, especially if they did not happen
to be of those who loved fighting for the privilege it
gave them to loot and ravage.</p>
<p>How the country people, all the Americans, indeed,
except the Tories, despised and dreaded the Hessian!
In fact he was no more brutal than many of the British,
but he was trained to loot and thus was held in disrepute.
On several occasions he had bayoneted the
American soldier after the latter had surrendered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t our men serve &#8217;em a like turn at Trenton?&#8221;
was a question some had asked.</p>
<p>Zeb well expressed the matter once when the subject
was being discussed around the camp-fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that job at Trenton was most complete.
Thar&#8217;s nothing about it to be ashamed of, an&#8217; everything
to be proud of. If we&#8217;d butchered the pig-stickers
when they were whinin&#8217; on their knees it
wouldn&#8217;t hev looked well in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There comes a detachment of &#8217;em now!&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
Rodney, the following morning. He and Zeb
were doing picket duty. The latter gave the call, and
several Rangers ran up. A half mile down the road
the Hessians came marching on in close order till they
arrived at some farm buildings when they were seen
to break ranks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em have it!&#8221; cried Zeb, bringing his long
rifle to his shoulder. Then, loading as he ran, he
called, &#8220;Come on, boys, let&#8217;s get to closer range.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other Rangers, hearing the firing, came running
after them. In doing this they not only obeyed orders,
but most of them gratified their own desire to get into
a skirmish with the enemy at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Soon the bullets were singing anything but a cheerful
song about the ears of the Hessians, who began to
reform their ranks and returned the fire. After several
of them had fallen in their tracks, the remainder
retreated, bearing off their dead and wounded, pursued
by the Rangers clear to the enemy&#8217;s lines, when they,
too, were compelled by overwhelming numbers to
retreat.</p>
<p>As they passed the farm on the way back, &#8220;Do-as-much
Bunster,&#8221; a Pennsylvania Dutchman, exclaimed,
&#8220;Dey vas not alretty till Christmas for roast pig to
vait, I tink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon your thinker is workin&#8217; this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; was
Zeb&#8217;s reply as he turned aside to look over into a pen
beside the road where a fine litter of white pigs lay
cuddled about the old sow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellers hev earned one o&#8217; them beauties,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
the farmer, coming out of his barn and proceeding to
slaughter one of the innocents without evident compunction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do as much for you zumtime,&#8221; said Bunster,
whereat all laughed. That was what the Dutchman
always said when any one did him a favour. He was
as good as his word, too, which not only gave him his
nickname but made him one of the most popular men
in his company.</p>
<p>He was both fat and jolly, as Dutchmen should be,
but not always are. His blue eyes twinkled with good
humour and shrewdness, and his eagerness showed that
he was fond of roast pig.</p>
<p>How good it tasted though cooked, as it had to be,
under unfavourable conditions over a camp-fire, and
without proper utensils. There was, however, a look
of contentment on the faces of those who partook of
the feast that afternoon, and sat around on the warm
ground licking their fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;Bunster and I and Rodney
are off duty to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yah, and I tink I zum sleep get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those Hesse-Cassel ruffians swaps even for
one good American, and there&#8217;s a lot of our boys
rottin&#8217; in the prison hulks in New York harbour
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is one way of saying we should capture a
few Hessians for a pastime; hey, Do-as-much Bunster?&#8221;
and Rodney thrust a forefinger into Bunster&#8217;s
fat ribs. The Dutchman squealed and leaped to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
feet, for he was so ticklish that one, wishing to see him
squirm, only had to point a finger at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That farmer is certain sure a good one, though he
is too lazy to take his pigs in out of danger. I hate
to see him lose &#8217;em. Besides he has a big rick o&#8217; hay
right nigh that pig pen an&#8217; it looked like a good place
to sleep. What d&#8217;ye say, boys, if we tote ourselves
down thar this evenin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zum place to sleep, yah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sleepy yet, but I am ready to go,&#8221; replied
Rodney, so they set out.</p>
<p>They crossed the fields, some of which were new
mown and fragrant. The sun was setting after a hot
day. The swallows skimmed over the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swallers flyin&#8217; low, sign o&#8217; rain,&#8221; said Zeb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t lay it on the swallows when the clouds
are piling up as they are this evening. We&#8217;ll want a
roof to the hay rick before morning, I think,&#8221; was
Rodney&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>They found the farmer doing his chores. His smile
was a trifle apprehensive as he said, &#8220;That pig tasted
so good ye come back fer more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We be no hogs. We reckoned as how the fellers
as didn&#8217;t git roast pig might come back and try it this
evenin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope ye don&#8217;t intend fightin&#8217; round here. My
wife Nancy is dretful nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My kind and tremulous friend, do ye want the
pig-stickers ter git yer pigs? We &#8217;lowed as how we
might stay here an&#8217; save yer next winter&#8217;s pork.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
&#8217;Sposin&#8217; you explain it to Nancy. We&#8217;ll not allow any
one to hurt her, if we can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seemed to satisfy the farmer; but he took
fresh alarm when Zeb went along to a two-wheeled
ox-cart, piled high with hay and backed against the
pen. As Zeb raised the tongue, and told Bunster to
put a stick under it, the farmer called excitedly,
&#8220;Look out! Ye&#8217;ll tip it into the pig pen; that load is
too heavy behind, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hay mought be good fer some kind o&#8217; hogs,&#8221;
which enigmatic remark by Zeb called forth no response
from the farmer, who bade them good night
and went into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand guard the first part or we&#8217;ll draw lots,
as you wish,&#8221; said Rodney.</p>
<p>It was decided to draw lots, but Rodney, drawing
the shortest straw, had his wish to stand guard the
first part of the night for, though tired, he was not
sleepy.</p>
<p>His companions threw themselves down on the hay
at the foot of the rick and soon, by their regular
breathing, he knew they slept. Sleep was a luxury
with the Rangers in those days of continuous scout
duty. Rodney&#8217;s nerves were high strung and no
sound escaped him. He heard the rustle of a toad
in the grass at his feet. An occasional mosquito
hummed about his ears. His mind wandered away to
that little Indian village he had known. In his imagination
he could hear the crooning song of the squaws
about the camp-fires, the shrill cries of the whip-poor-will.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
He thought of the old Indian chief, whose savage
hands had so often grasped the rifle the boy now
held. Had Ahneota lived he doubtless would be encouraging
the red men in aid of the British, and would
not hesitate to torture women and children as well as
men. How he hated the whites!</p>
<p>Hark! What was that sound? Surely the clink of
the iron shoe of a horse on a stone in the road!</p>
<p>The boy waked his sleeping companions. They
seized their rifles and all went nearer the road.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness misshapen objects could just
be discerned, and the guttural voices of several Hessians
could be heard. Then a light glimmered as
one of the approaching party drew an old horn
lantern from under his cloak. Two others, by aid
of the light, clambered into the pen, leaving outside
the one with the lantern and the fourth holding the
horse.</p>
<p>The next moment a pig squealed. The vandals
were sticking them with their bayonets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; whispered Zeb, running forward and
tilting the cart tongue in the air, dumping the load
of hay into the pen, and burying human and other
hogs in the mire underneath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surrender!&#8221; Zeb cried, thrusting the muzzle of
his rifle under the nose of the fellow holding the lantern,
while Rodney and Bunster disarmed the Hessian
with the horse. Then Zeb quickly tied their hands
behind their backs, and, telling Rodney to guard them
and shoot them down if they moved hand or foot, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
and Bunster turned their attention to the commotion
in the pig pen.</p>
<p>From under the hay there issued grunts and squeals
and German oaths. Sorry looking hirelings were
those two Hessians when they crawled out into the
light. Wisps of hay clung to their well greased pigtail
queues and their hated uniforms, blue coats and
yellow waistcoats, were daubed with muck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass out yer guns, an&#8217; take this fork an&#8217; pitch out
the hay,&#8221; was Zeb&#8217;s order, which the dazed prisoners
attempted to obey, when the farmer, calling out the
window, said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll look out fer that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better let him, Zeb,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;If we stay
here too long we may have more Hessians than we
need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good advice, ye townsman of the immortal Jefferson.
Forward march.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE RANGERS SENT AGAINST BURGOYNE</h3>
</div>
<p>England proposed to snuff out the rebellion
that summer of 1777: so she sent all the troops
she could spare and hire, also bribes to secure
the services of the Indians. England must win,
though the savages kill and torture every man, woman
and child on the frontier.</p>
<p>General Burgoyne must leave the writing of plays
for a time and lead an army from Canada down to
New York, and then Philadelphia was to be captured
and the Continental Congress sent a-packing.</p>
<p>Howe is said to have thought the Burgoyne plan
unwise, for he knew something about war, though
frequently too indolent to put his knowledge into practice.
This beautiful month of June he had his army
down in New Jersey, watching for a chance to outwit
Washington and seize Philadelphia.</p>
<p>After the first failure, he abandoned New Brunswick
and marched his troops back to New York. Here
was an opportunity for Morgan&#8217;s Rangers. They followed
Howe&#8217;s army like a swarm of angry hornets.
When too annoying, the British would turn and drive
them back, but, as soon as the march was resumed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
they would return and again sting the rear of the
column into desperation.</p>
<p>When the Rangers first came in contact with the
retreating British the latter were crossing a bridge.
Here was a fine opportunity for Morgan&#8217;s men, and
they used it to the fullest extent. Their bullets laid
many a poor Hessian in the dust, for the aim of the
riflemen was quick and accurate, whereas that of the
British was mechanical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Another bee has stung that arm. The redcoats
intend to get it, I believe,&#8221; suddenly cried Rodney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does yer arm feel numb?&#8221; asked Zeb.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I guess it&#8217;s just a scratch. Anyhow I&#8217;m going
to use it while I may.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, our two comrades lost no time examining
trifling wounds, while British bullets whistled about
their ears. On the contrary, they were loading and
firing as rapidly as possible, and the perspiration was
streaming down their powder-blackened faces, for the
day was hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to support the column; look out
for a volley. Git down here, lie low,&#8221; and, suiting
action to word, Zeb threw himself on the grass.</p>
<p>A body of Hessians had wheeled about and posted
themselves behind some temporary breastworks, which
had been thrown up that morning. &#8220;Up and at &#8217;em,&#8221;
was the word, and the Rangers ran forward and threw
themselves on the ground so that most of the volley
from the enemy passed over their heads.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Up and at &#8217;em&#8221; again, each time nearer, while
flanking parties were working around toward the rear
of the redoubts. The enemy behind the breastworks
had the advantage both in number and position, and
held back the Rangers, who had no bayonets and could
not charge successfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes General Wayne&#8217;s brigade, now we&#8217;ll
dislodge &#8217;em,&#8221; shouted Zeb in his excitement, and Bunster
stood up and cheered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll teach &#8217;em that they have to earn their money
when they hire out to lick Americans,&#8221; cried Rodney.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Bunster!&#8221; exclaimed Zeb,
for their companion staggered and pitched forward in
a heap, his hands convulsively clutching the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;They run, they run, at &#8217;em, boys!&#8221; and, with this
cry in their ears, Rodney and Zeb charged down on
the flying enemy.</p>
<p>Bunster lay face down in the field. How he would
have yelled and run after the retreating Hessians! He
had made his last charge, poor Bunster! Such a genial
fellow; such a kindly, helpful soul, with no fear in
your heart! You have done as much as the best and
bravest of them, and your country can never do as
much for you.</p>
<p>At the first opportunity his companions sought him
out from among the slain, and laid him in a hastily
constructed grave. Zeb&#8217;s eyes were wet and tears
made furrows among the powder stains on Rodney&#8217;s
face. Their hearts would be hardened in the days of
war to come, for that is one of war&#8217;s penalties. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
sympathy they might have would be rather with those
writhing and waiting for death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s a heap o&#8217; walkin&#8217; ahead of the Rangers,&#8221;
was Zeb&#8217;s greeting as he returned from a talk with
their colonel several days later.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Schuyler an&#8217; Gates are howlin&#8217; fer more men an&#8217;
expect Washington to furnish &#8217;em whether he has &#8217;em
or not. Burgoyne&#8217;s comin&#8217; down Lake Champlain
with a horde of red devils at his heels, an&#8217; the country
people up that way don&#8217;t feel easy about their hair,
with the lovely flag of England wavin&#8217; over &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just heard a report that the farmers were taking
the field. If they do as well as they did at Bunker Hill,
Burgoyne may not have an altogether pleasant summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s too many people in this country who want
to be independent of everything, even to fightin&#8217; whenever
and how they please. It&#8217;s time they did something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly they don&#8217;t respond very promptly to
Washington&#8217;s call for troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This war has got to be won, if it&#8217;s won at all, by
armies an&#8217; not by a few men shootin&#8217; from behind a
stone wall whenever the Britishers march their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be said that Morgan&#8217;s Rangers don&#8217;t respond
when called upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. The country will remember us after
we&#8217;re killed. We&#8217;ve got a reputation for fighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
already. Two thirds of us &#8217;d rather be at a fight than
a feast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You among the number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not right. I hate war except when I get in a
skirmish, an&#8217; then I don&#8217;t think about it. I wish the
men who bring on war had to do the fightin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howe, twice foiled in his attempts to outwit Washington,
had returned to New York, leaving his antagonist
in doubt whether he proposed taking his army
up the Hudson to meet Burgoyne or around to Philadelphia
by sea. During this period of uncertainty,
Morgan&#8217;s Rangers marched to Hackensack and back
again. They travelled light, each man lugging his
provisions, rations of corn meal and a wallet containing
dried venison. August 16th they received final
orders to march to Peekskill, and there to take boats
for Albany to join Gates&#8217; army.</p>
<p>Here at last was something definite, and how the
men cheered! Washington was sending his best men
to aid Gates because he thought the country needed
them at that place. George Washington was a big
enough man to forget self and think only of his country.
Gates was not, and was to repay his chief for
this assistance with treachery.</p>
<p>Rodney never forgot that day when they first came
in sight of the beautiful Hudson. He made some remark
about the scenery, when the man next him in
line exclaimed: &#8220;Whew! but I&#8217;d like plenty of shade
trees in my scenery,&#8221; wiping away the perspiration
with his sleeve.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ab, you are in as big a hurry to git thar as any
of us,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel right certain about matters after we
do. Thar must be some rattle-headed men in charge
up in this country; what with fillin&#8217; ol&#8217; Ty full o&#8217; powder
an&#8217; ball an&#8217; then allowin&#8217; the Britishers to climb a
hill an&#8217; drive &#8217;em out the fort. Thar sure be some
folks as think they&#8217;re ginerals by grace o&#8217; good
looks an&#8217; lots o&#8217; friends. Then some feller, as
knows how, comes along an&#8217; trees &#8217;em,&#8221; was Ab&#8217;s
reply.</p>
<p>A warm welcome awaited the Rangers when they
joined the northern army. In fact all along their route
they had received admiration and cordial greeting to
their hearts&#8217; content. Gates flattered Morgan by arranging
that the colonel should receive orders only
from the general in command. Quarters were assigned
them at Loudon&#8217;s Ferry, and here they were
joined by Major Dearborn with two hundred and fifty
men selected from other regiments. This was pleasing
to Morgan, as he and Dearborn had fought the
enemy at Quebec, where both had been taken prisoners.</p>
<p>The Rangers welcomed the recruits heartily, and
proceeded to get acquainted. In the midst of this
Rodney saw a fine looking fellow, of about his own
age, clad in the uniform of the Massachusetts militia,
run toward Zeb, exclaiming, &#8220;I might have known if
I could find Colonel Morgan I could find you, in flesh
or spirit. How are you, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shades of the Great North, Don, yer face looks
good ter me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, after they had shaken hands and patted each
other on the shoulder, literally and metaphorically,
Zeb, turning to Rodney, said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s Donald Lovell,
the lad who found me in a Quebec snowdrift an&#8217; saved
my life when I was about as fer gone as poor Bunster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, Zeb. I don&#8217;t want to tell all you did for
me, there isn&#8217;t time, but I&#8217;m glad to know any one
that&#8217;s your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You two boys make a likely pair. Ye both really
do credit to my judgment in pickin&#8217; ye out. How
long ye been here, Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few days. You&#8217;ve heard about Stark and
the battle at Bennington, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We certain have. He gave those Hessians a
sound drubbing if reports are correct. He was at
Trenton, you know. Was disgruntled, because he
didn&#8217;t get the promotion he wanted, an&#8217; went home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky he did. He was just the man needed to
do that job at Bennington. I went as messenger to
Portsmouth and heard John Langdon, the speaker
of the New Hampshire assembly, pledge his property
to fit out Stark. That&#8217;s the kind of statesmen to
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A durned sight better than the majority of those
in Congress. Whar is yer Uncle Dick, at home worryin&#8217;
about ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald laughed, and then his face grew serious as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
he said, &#8220;No. He joined Stark and I&#8217;m the one who
is worrying about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;General Arnold played a good trick on St. Leger,
when he sent that decoy messenger to him with the
cock-and-bull story about the reinforcements marching
to Fort Stanwix bein&#8217; thicker than the leaves on
the trees,&#8221; remarked Zeb.</p>
<p>&#8220;And wasn&#8217;t that a glorious fight poor old Herkimer&#8217;s
men made against the Tories and Brandt&#8217;s Indians?
That must have been terrible, a regular hand-to-hand
struggle. Yes, Arnold is here and many think
he should have the command.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m one o&#8217; the number,&#8221; said Zeb, stoutly.
&#8220;That man has more courage an&#8217; energy than the
whole Continental Congress. Look at the way he
fought in the Canadian campaign! They tell me,
though the British defeated the fleet of boats he built
to oppose &#8217;em on the lake, that no man ever led a
braver struggle against greater odds and got away
without bein&#8217; captured. He was ready to resign before
this Burgoyne campaign, an&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t hev blamed
him. He doesn&#8217;t know how to git along without
making enemies, for, when he has anything to do, he
goes at it hammer and tongs no matter whose toes he
treads on, but he gets it done, by hook or by crook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Zeb, that somehow I never had great
liking for him, but he certainly is a brave, resourceful
leader. I think he&#8217;s the most ambitious man in the
service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s willing to earn his promotion, which some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
of &#8217;em wouldn&#8217;t if they knew how. He&#8217;s earned it ten
times over. The men who can do things are the ones
we&#8217;ve got to have to win. One thing, this army isn&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to lack fer men, such as they are, by the way the
farmers are comin&#8217; in with their old guns and hay
hooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such as they are! Zeb, you&#8217;re a dyed-in-the-wool
Virginian. These New Englanders and New
Yorkers coming into camp are of the same mettle as
those under Stark and those who died with Herkimer.
There are no better men in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon ye better make an exception o&#8217; the Rangers.
They sent us down here, when we ought to be
with Washington, specially to save you people from
the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the day you started, Stark and his New
Hampshire and Massachusetts men, with the help of
Seth Warner&#8217;s men, won a victory which will result
in the defeat of Burgoyne. You Virginians are all
right; you have your Washington and Morgan and
the Rangers, but don&#8217;t cry down the Northern farmers
in their homespun. They&#8217;ve had to fight for a living
from the beginning, and, from Lexington right
down through till now, they&#8217;ve fought for their
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except when they&#8217;ve left to go home and gather
their crops. Soldiers who stay in the field till the
war&#8217;s over are the kind that is needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; interrupted Rodney, for the conversation
had waxed warm, &#8220;but, from what Zeb told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
me, both Virginia and Massachusetts were needed to
pull through the wilderness on the way to Quebec.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeb laughed and said, &#8220;I reckon Virginia and
Massachusetts will have to hang together if we get
the job done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we don&#8217;t,&#8221; added Donald, with a laugh,
&#8220;they&#8217;ll hang separately, as Dr. Franklin said of the
signers of the Declaration of Independence.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>PUT TO THE TEST</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Likely lookin&#8217; men Dearborn&#8217;s picked up,&#8221;
was Zeb&#8217;s comment as Major Dearborn
marched his recruits past. &#8220;Hi, Don. An&#8217;
thar&#8217;s his uncle. Glad he got through Bennington
safe an&#8217; sound. Don was some worried about him.
Man an&#8217; boy, ye can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His uncle is a fine looking man. Those men have
bayonets. They ought to be of service. But there&#8217;s
none like the Rangers, eh, Zeb?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Askin&#8217; such questions is waste o&#8217; breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope we&#8217;ll soon have a chance to prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been sayin&#8217; the same thing for more&#8217;n two
weeks. I reckoned we sure would get it two days
ago when we occupied Bemis Heights. Hello!
What&#8217;s doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fall in!&#8221;</p>
<p>As though there were magic in the words, those
travel-stained riflemen sprang to their places with an
eagerness never seen among regular troops.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enemy is crossing the Hudson, an&#8217; we&#8217;re to
make &#8217;em wish they hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; was the message which
ran along the lines. Many a man turned to the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
in line and said in matter of fact tone, &#8220;That means
fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; exclaimed Rodney, as they came
in sight of the solid lines of the British army. Under
Burgoyne were some of the finest soldiers Europe
could produce. They marched in compact lines, moving
like weighted machines under their heavy trappings
which were gorgeous and imposing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t intend to leave any hole for us to
wedge in,&#8221; said Rodney.</p>
<p>Ah! There opens a way to get at that German regiment.
Morgan sees it and the battle is on. It was,
however, only a brief skirmish; a few volleys, a few
human beings stretched on the ground dead and
wounded, a few prisoners. France, across the water,
waiting for something decisive, before committing
herself to the cause of America, will hear of it and of
battles to come. But many more men than were with
Morgan that day would be required to stop that British
army. On they came and established their camp
within two miles of that of the Americans.</p>
<p>Between these armies the land was rough and hilly,
part of it covered with forests. Well out in front of
the American army Morgan&#8217;s corps was stationed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything happens we&#8217;re likely to be the first to
know it,&#8221; was Rodney&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for. We&#8217;re the whiskers,
the feelers o&#8217; the cat that&#8217;s set to watch the mouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A full grown rat, I&#8217;d say, by the size.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six to eight thousand, includin&#8217; Tories an&#8217; redskins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
who won&#8217;t count when the pinch comes. By
the way the country folks are comin&#8217; in with their
rifles an&#8217; pitchforks we&#8217;re in a fair way to snare the
lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeb, you certainly are the most hopeful man I
ever knew. Anyhow, if Burgoyne wants to eat his
Christmas dinner in New York, he&#8217;s got to give us a
chance at him soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evidently Burgoyne arrived at a like conclusion.
On the morning of September nineteenth the pickets
reported the British advancing. Morgan&#8217;s corps was
immediately ordered forward to engage the enemy
and delay his progress. The gallant Major Morris led
one line and Morgan the other, and Morris encountered
the enemy first, a picket detachment of about
three hundred men. The Rangers charged and drove
them, and followed so impetuously on their heels as
to run into the main body, and as a result of such
recklessness they suffered severely. Morris rode right
into the midst of the British, but, wheeling his horse,
escaped and rejoined his men, who were now badly
scattered. Donald Lovell received a severe wound in
his side. His uncle, marching by his side, picked him
up as though a child, and across his powerful shoulders
carried him back to a place of safety.</p>
<p>Morgan, hearing the firing, was hurrying on to support
the other line when, finding it broken and scattered,
he is said to have shed tears in his chagrin at
what he thought was due to carelessness and meant
defeat. Were the Rangers, the pride of the army, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
be shattered in their first encounter after all their
boasting? It is not surprising that Morgan felt that
his fondest hopes had been recklessly ruined.</p>
<p>But the Rangers had been trained for just such
emergencies and, when their colonel blew the &#8220;turkey
call&#8221; on the bone whistle which he carried, and those
piercing sounds were heard above the din of battle,
his men rallied.</p>
<p>Quickly they formed into line, eager to regain what
they had lost. Every man felt that his country and
the honour of his corps were at stake, and he was ready
to die if necessary. Already the afternoon was half
gone, but before night could stop the bloodshed many
a man would pay the penalty of a soldier; some of
those lithe, bronzed, hardy fellows, throbbing with
health and vitality, would not see the sun rise over
Bemis Heights on the morrow.</p>
<p>In the forest ahead a little clearing had been made
for a small farm, and there the Rangers came upon
the advance line of the enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll get it hot!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney under
his breath, but among them all not a face paled nor a
hand grasping a rifle trembled. On, directly at the
British, the men ran like deer, except a few detailed
to duty as sharpshooters, dodging behind stumps or
climbing trees as agile as monkeys. On go the Rangers.
Now the British fire into the line and some
fall.</p>
<p>Why do they not return the fire? Ah! now their
rifles leap to shoulder at close range and every shot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
tells! What ghastly gaps are left in the British ranks,
and the Rangers are still rushing on like demons, loading
as they run! It is too much for those fighting
machines accustomed to fight, as they march, with
mathematical precision; they turn and run. Back
they go to the hill behind, where there are reinforcements
waiting with cannon, the riflemen at their heels.
Oh, the cruelty of it all, shooting, stabbing, yelling!</p>
<p>Now the British swarm upon the meagre lines of
the Rangers and the latter are forced back, literally by
weight of numbers. And, as they retreat, a British
detachment is sent around to attack them on the flank.
They press forward, expecting to crumple up Morgan&#8217;s
men like tall grain in the hand of the reaper! They
will teach those rude fellows a lesson, that Americans
can&#8217;t stand before the trained soldiers of Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here come the New Hampshire boys!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stalwart men they were, those men from New
Hampshire, led by Cilley and Scammel. Their training
in military matters had been meagre, indeed, but
they fight, and Morgan&#8217;s men rally for another onslaught,
and again another, for they will not stop until
darkness stops them. Hurrah! now they have the
cannon, but the retreating British wisely carry the
linstocks with them so the cannon may not be turned
against them, and later they are able to recapture
them.</p>
<p>Backward and forward, yells of triumph on one
side and again on the other. Rodney and Zeb keep
together. There is blood on the side of young Allison&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
face, scratched by a bullet, as he would have
said, had he known it. &#8220;On and at &#8217;em.&#8221; Down
goes Zeb, his companions in their onward rush leaping
aside or over his prostrate body. Rodney saw
him fall, but what could he do? If they ever came
back he would find him. He doesn&#8217;t forget, and, when
they come staggering back through the smoke, with
the British bayonets behind them, Zeb is carried to
the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lucky it&#8217;s no worse, Zeb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the feller said as lost both legs. If
I can keep clear o&#8217; the scalpin&#8217; knife I&#8217;ll fight agin,
sure&#8217;s yer born!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m alive to do it I&#8217;ll see that you are taken
off the field to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know ye will if the redcoats don&#8217;t take the field
away from ye. If they do, the red devils will get more
scalps than they can carry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t got it yet. Here we go again,&#8221; and,
saying this, he joined the mass of running men returning
to the charge.</p>
<p>There was the same din, the same clouds of acrid
powder smoke, which now is lifted by a breeze, showing
the solid ranks awaiting them. As Rodney fires
he is conscious that he has shot an Indian, an Indian
with blue eyes! What was an Indian doing in those
serried ranks, why wasn&#8217;t he skulking on the outskirts
as Indians should? The enemy yield, and are driven
back on to a rise of land in their rear, where they make
a stand and again hurl back the riflemen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>As the Rangers retreat, Rodney sees the Indian lying
on the ground lift his rifle to shoot. A Ranger
knocks it aside, while another aims a blow that would
have brained the savage had not Rodney knocked it
aside, for he had recognized Conrad!</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me to take him,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill him an&#8217; leave him,&#8221; cried another.</p>
<p>Rodney grasped Conrad by the shoulders and another
rifleman, with a growl at such folly, seized him
by the heels. So it happened that he was laid by the
side of Zeb.</p>
<p>By this time the battle raged along the entire front.
American reinforcements were coming up and greater
reinforcements were being sent to support the British,
and Gates was back in his tent thinking it all a small
affair.</p>
<p>With nightfall the two armies lay back like panting
wolves, exhausted, and, now that there was time, Rodney
made sure that both Zeb and Conrad had their
wounds dressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Rangers won glory to-day and bore the brunt
of the fighting. It was hot, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re correct, Rodney. I felt of it an&#8217;
found it so,&#8221; was Zeb&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is reported about camp that Gates and Arnold
have quarrelled, and Arnold was so mad he resigned
and Gates accepted it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so!&#8221; Zeb whistled, and then made a wry
face on account of the pain in his leg. &#8220;That leaves
Arnold in a pickle. &#8217;Taint the height o&#8217; military etiquette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
to resign under fire. I wish Arnold was in
command, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t the only one who wishes it. Well, I
must find that Indian or he won&#8217;t forgive me for
shooting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad ye can&#8217;t shoot straighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unkind. When you know him you&#8217;ll
change your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of what happened in the two weeks following this
battle, history tells but little, for there was little that
was decisive. Burgoyne waited for Clinton to come
to his assistance. He did not come. Some of his
messages did not get through the lines to Burgoyne.
The Americans gradually got control of vantage
points between the British and their avenue of retreat
to Canada. But these were not dull days for the Rangers.
There was scouting and skirmishing in which
they bore an active part.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of October seventh Rodney
brought in word that the British troops were moving,
and Gates quickly ordered Morgan forward to engage
them. The latter, as was his custom, had obtained a
knowledge of the country and he saw a better plan,
which was to lead his men around to a wooded hill on
the enemy&#8217;s flank and attack from there. This suggestion
was approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will begin the end,&#8221; remarked a fellow on
Rodney&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless Gates blunders,&#8221; remarked another.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>There before them lay a panorama which might
well stir the blood, the finest looking soldiers in the
world forming on the plain below.</p>
<p>General Poor&#8217;s men were advancing to engage the
enemy in front. Now is the moment for Morgan&#8217;s
men!</p>
<p>How they swept down on those British regulars,
loading and shooting as they charged, and every ball
finding its mark!</p>
<p>The enemy&#8217;s volleys were not those of marksmen
and did comparatively little execution. Now Dearborn&#8217;s
men are charging with the bayonet, and sharpshooters
are picking off the British officers. Human
beings could not stand under such an onslaught. The
enemy&#8217;s lines wavered, and then were swept off the
field by the soldiers they had ridiculed. What will
the King of France think when he hears of this?</p>
<p>Ah! there rides Frazer, gallant soldier, rallying the
disheartened British troops. Frazer is a host in himself.
If he succeeds, he may turn the tide of battle.
What! he reels in his saddle and aides ride to his side
and he leaves the field to die a few hours later. Those
Rangers back on the hill seldom miss the mark.</p>
<p>The enemy shield themselves behind their entrenchments,
and the Americans, flushed with victory, are
charging them, and there goes Arnold riding the field
like a madman, though Gates has ordered him to remain
in camp. It shall not be said he resigned through
fear, if he dies for it. But this desperate charge could
not succeed, and Morgan&#8217;s men turn back and Arnold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
is wounded in the same leg that was shot during the
attack on Quebec. The British admire bravery and
Arnold&#8217;s portrait is to decorate shop windows in London
for the curious to gape at. Alas for Arnold that
the bullet was not better aimed!</p>
<p>At last it is night. The Americans have not been
able to deliver the finishing stroke, but the British
have learned that their fate is not to be a pleasant one,
whatever happens.</p>
<p>These are but glimpses of that eventful struggle.
The history of it is another story and a thrilling one.</p>
<p>We may think of Rodney and Zeb exulting as the
days passed and they saw the American lines tighten
about the hesitating enemy, hesitating only to be lost.
Conrad, true to the manners of his adopted people, sat
in stolid silence, seeing much and saying nothing, while
his wound quickly healed. And there is Gates, so
anxious for glory&ndash;&ndash;he thinks now that he may get
Washington&#8217;s place,&ndash;&ndash;that he is willing to agree that
Burgoyne&#8217;s soldiers may return to England if only
they&#8217;ll fight no more against America, and we may
imagine the smile on the face of the English general.
Nor is it difficult to imagine the dark red of anger in
Colonel Morgan&#8217;s face when Gates seeks his support
for the place of commander-in-chief, and the &#8220;old
wagoner&#8221; curtly tells him that he will have no part
in such a scheme, that he will fight under Washington
or not fight at all.</p>
<p>Zeb was sufficiently recovered from his wound to be
able to see the British troops march past on the day of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the surrender, looking down the ranks of Americans,
some trim and soldierly, as were the Continentals, and
others clad in homespun or the skins of the forest.
And in the ranks filing past in dejection Rodney saw
the sneering face of Mogridge. The flower of the
British aristocracy, sons of nobility and members of
Parliament, had been subalterns under Burgoyne.
Mogridge, as ever, had followed in the wake of those
having money so that he might live as the leech
lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have got a furlough, and as soon as this wound
will let me I&#8217;m going to Boston to see the folks.&#8221; And
at the moment Zeb said this he was carrying, in an
inside pocket of his dirty hunting shirt, a letter from
Melicite, the fair young French girl whose kindness
to him and young Lovell in Quebec had won from him
more than mere friendship.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going down into Connecticut to find the
girl who sewed her name inside my coat,&#8221; remarked
a militia man standing by; for there were girls who
won husbands by this simple little device, stitching
their fate into the homespun coats they made for the
soldiers.</p>
<p>Rodney turned away, feeling a bit lonely. He
would find Conrad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conrad, if I can get you freed will you promise
me to live a friend to Americans and, on getting back
to your people, will find Louis and bring him to my
home in Charlottesville?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>For several minutes Conrad made no reply, and then
he said: &#8220;Yah, I vill.&#8221; And so it came about that,
when his wound was healed, he turned his face toward
his chosen home in the forest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>TRICKED, AND BY HIS FRIEND</h3>
</div>
<p>Burgoyne, on meeting Colonel Morgan after
the surrender, had said to him: &#8220;Sir, you command
the finest regiment in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A feller with ornary jedgment mought reach that
ar conclusion with half the experience,&#8221; remarked a
lank old rifleman, whose peculiar gait had given him
the name of &#8220;Lopin&#8217; Luther.&#8221; Nevertheless, the compliment
greatly pleased the Rangers. It could not,
however, remedy the injustice done Morgan and his
corps by Gates in not making favourable mention of
them because the &#8220;old wagoner&#8221; so sturdily refused
to participate in Gates&#8217; scheme to supplant Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nawthin&#8217; ter do but keep at it; sun&#8217;ll be shinin&#8217;
bimeby,&#8221; was the terse comment of one of the Rangers,
and his was the philosophy which prevailed.</p>
<p>Rodney thought of the Indian saying: &#8220;My foot is
on the path and the word is onward,&#8221; when, on the
first of November, orders came to join Washington&#8217;s
army.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll be under a general as will play fair,&#8221;
was the way one rifleman expressed the general sentiment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
and they set out on their journey, war-worn and
ragged and weary with the arduous campaigning of
the previous months.</p>
<p>As they marched away, one of the number sang to
improvised music those stirring words written by the
Reverend Timothy Dwight, one of the army chaplains:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,<br />
<span class='indent5'>&nbsp;</span>The queen of the world, and the child of the skies.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Sorry looking Rangers were they when they arrived
at Washington&#8217;s headquarters; shoes worn out, clothes
in tatters. There they found a dwindling army. The
battles of the Brandywine and Germantown had been
fought in their absence, and the British were in Philadelphia,
planning for a hilarious winter. What remained
of the American army must exist outside in
the cold of a bitter winter and do what they might to
keep the enemy where it was and cut off its supplies
whenever possible. Those of the Rangers who had
suitable clothing were immediately assigned to duty.
At Gloucester Point they bore themselves so creditably
that Lafayette said of them: &#8220;I never saw men so
merry, so spirited and so desirous to go on to the
enemy....&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, at Chestnut Hill, their unerring rifles did such
execution that Howe&#8217;s soldiers bore a sorry burden
back to Philadelphia. There were sad gaps, as well,
in the ranks of the Rangers, and among those fatally
wounded was the gallant Morris who had charged the
line at Bemis Heights.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>As usual, the Rangers were assigned to outpost duty
and scouting. Owing to need of secrecy, many a bitter
winter night was passed by Rangers in this work without
a camp-fire. These were wretched weeks for Rodney
Allison; and there were moments when they
seemed worse than the days of his captivity among the
Indians. Then he would be reminded that Morgan&#8217;s
men were noted as well for endurance and fortitude as
for courage and skill. It should not be said that the
son of David Allison flinched or shirked a duty!</p>
<p>At the close of one cold, gray day spent on guard
the officer in charge of the guard said to Rodney:
&#8220;Can ye keep awake all night? I needn&#8217;t ask ye
though; ye&#8217;ve got to, fer thar be no men left to do the
job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This mornin&#8217; one of our scouts saw a British officer
ride to a house &#8217;bout half a mile from here. We
sent three Rangers down thar an&#8217; hunted high an&#8217; low,
but hide nor hair could they find. I &#8217;low he&#8217;s thar an&#8217;
to-night he&#8217;ll try to git ter Philadelphy. You got ter
go down thar an&#8217; stop him. If a word won&#8217;t do, try
a bullet.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a dismal prospect. The wind was cutting,
and Rodney&#8217;s clothes were worn thin. The weather
was almost too cold for snow, but by night it fell in
fine, stinging particles. Out on the road young Allison
tramped to and fro to keep warm, occasionally
stopping to thresh his arms. Late in the evening he
saw someone go to the stable, and soon after a double
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
team was driven out. The door of the house opened
and a woman came out and entered the carriage.
There were good-byes spoken in loud tones with no
apparent attempt at concealment. Rodney was no
coward, but in his heart he was glad that, instead of
two men, he had only one and a woman to deal with.
The woman might scream but probably wouldn&#8217;t
shoot.</p>
<p>The driver cracked his whip and the team came
down the road at a rattling pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221;</p>
<p>The word rang sharply on the ears of the driver,
a black man, and he quickly brought his horses to a
standstill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive back. My orders are to allow no one to
leave that house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You surely aren&#8217;t making war on women,&#8221; said
the girl, opening the door of her carriage, and her
voice sounded strangely familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am making war on no one who obeys orders,&#8221;
he replied, his rifle levelled at the driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Rodney Allison? It is!&#8221; Then she
laughed, such a merry, rollicking laugh, which the
next instant gave place to indignation, as she exclaimed:
&#8220;You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
What have I done that I should not be permitted to
return to Philadelphia? Am I the man your backwoodsmen
searched the house for, do you think?
Black Pete does not greatly resemble any British
officer I ever saw,&#8221; and then she laughed again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
&#8220;And I&#8217;m not forage, am I? And there&#8217;s not a soul
but me in this carriage; look for yourself. There,
now tell Pete to drive on, please. After all, I&#8217;m glad
to see you. And send my love to your mother and
Naomi, won&#8217;t you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney hesitated. She was the same imperious,
winsome girl who had been his favourite playmate.
No, there was no one inside the carriage; he was sure
of that. How the men would laugh at him for capturing
a negro and a girl! He felt like a ninny and
afraid he might look like one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive on,&#8221; he said with all the importance he could
command, adding: &#8220;I am sorry to delay you, but must
obey orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; she called back as she rode away.
The coachman was plying the whip, and there was a
note of triumph in her voice that somehow jarred on
Rodney&#8217;s nerves.</p>
<p>As he paced back and forth the conviction that he
had made a grave mistake grew upon him, though for
his life he could not be sure why it might be a mistake.
Why need he say anything about the affair? The men
would only joke him. Yes, he would tell the whole
story and take the responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did ye inspect the inside o&#8217; the nigger as well as
the carriage?&#8221; was the question sharply asked him by
the officer the following day, when it was found that
the officer&#8217;s horse was gone from the stable, and that
every slave on the place had run away the day before,
just after the search of the house.</p>

<p>Assuming the disguise of a black menial was the
last thing he would have suspected a haughty British
officer to do!</p>
<p>Oh, but the disappointment was a bitter one! He
had expected promotion. Certainly he had earned it.
Now, that hope was gone. His blunder was the jest
of his comrades, who would call after him: &#8220;Nigger
in the woodpile, nigger on the box.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan, troubled with rheumatism, had gone to his
home in Winchester for the winter. The army was
half starved and poorly clothed, and to make matters
worse, it was generally understood that these hardships
were due to corruption and incompetency; for
there were some in authority, in those days, who were
greedy, dishonest and hard-hearted.</p>
<p>Young Allison had occasion to visit the camp at
Valley Forge and the sights he saw there never left his
memory. Wretchedness and misery were on every
side. How did Washington, knowing as he must
that these conditions were unnecessary under proper
management, how could he hope ever to save the
country?</p>
<p>Who was that haggard fellow with bare feet
wrapped in rags and little but an old horse blanket to
keep out the wintry wind? Angus? Yes, no doubt
of it!</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Rod! Say, you fellers as hev breeches ought
ter bring us in a bite ter eat. What&#8217;s the good o&#8217; your
foragin&#8217; if yer don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a mouthful since last night, myself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
How are you, anyway? I don&#8217;t see how you men can
stay here and bear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of us wouldn&#8217;t if we&#8217;d the duds ter git away
in. It&#8217;s a hard road ter Charlottesville fer bare feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to feel like taking it. When we
drive the British out of the Quaker City then we&#8217;ll
apply for a furlough, eh, Angus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d go this minute if I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt it, Angus. You always were a tenacious
fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the good o&#8217; stayin&#8217; when Congress won&#8217;t
provide board an&#8217; clothes? They sure are a shiftless
lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They might easily be improved, it would seem,
but we&#8217;ve gone too far in this war to turn back now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Starvin&#8217; an&#8217; freezin&#8217; ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter help ther cause
none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spring will soon be here and we&#8217;ll feel better, I
hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spring was approaching, and never again was the
American army to suffer as it did that winter at Valley
Forge. Those who endured, and lived through it,
won such glory as few men achieve.</p>
<p>Colonel Morgan rejoined his command in the spring.
The enemy were beginning to show signs of animation.
Rumours were about that Howe intended to leave
Philadelphia, and then another to the effect that he
was to be recalled.</p>
<p>One day a company of Rangers was sent to support
Lafayette at Barren Hill, Rodney among the number.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Two British generals were marching their men by
different routes from Philadelphia to capture the distinguished
Frenchman and his command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; thought young Allison, &#8220;is my chance,&#8221;
and he set his face, which had noticeably hardened
during the cruel winter. No more would it look with
favour on the flattering smiles of a girl; at least Rodney
had so resolved.</p>
<p>When the charge was made in characteristic Ranger
manner, Allison was in the front line and was the last
to turn back, though there were several bullet holes in
his clothes. Another charge, and again he was in the
lead. A big redcoat was upon him before he could
reload. He clubbed his rifle, knocked aside the bayonet
thrust and felled his antagonist. Then, when he
turned to retreat, it was too late; a flanking party was
at his back, and, with several other prisoners, he was
driven off to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Into the Provost Prison on Walnut Street he was
huddled along with others. Oh, the squalor of it! The
air was foul, the food poor, and the officer in charge,
Captain Cunningham, a brutal man, inflamed with
drink most of the time.</p>
<p>How his head ached the following morning! At
first he attributed it to the foul air, but surely that
could not cause every bone in his body to ache, nor
the parched, feverish condition of his mouth. Was he,
after so long escaping the hazards of camp and battle,
to die in a hole like that old prison? That had been
the fate of many a man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Allison. I&#8217;m glad, yet sorry, to find you
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney looked up. They had just brought in Lawrence
Enderwood. For a few minutes, in the pleasure
of companionship, the lad forgot the fever pains, but
they would not be forgotten for long.</p>
<p>Enderwood entreated Cunningham to send a doctor,
but was gruffly told to mind his business. The next
morning Rodney was delirious.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>A BLENDED ROSE</h3>
</div>
<p>For weeks the Quaker City girls had been looking
forward with much anticipation and great
eagerness to the eighteenth day of May, 1778.
On that day there was to be a most wonderful, grand
and gorgeous pageant in honour of the Howes.</p>
<p>There was much chirping and fluttering those evenings
in the homes of the Shippens, the Chews, the
Achmutys, the Redmans, and others. In the midst of
all this lived Elizabeth Danesford, and a very lively
part of it she was.</p>
<p>Among all the Philadelphia beauties&ndash;&ndash;and none in
all this great land or the lands across the seas could
excel them&ndash;&ndash;Lisbeth was a peeress. About her shrine
could be found as many worshippers as any of the
charming queens could boast. Scions of Britain&#8217;s aristocracy,
favoured with a glimpse from under her dark
lashes, forgot their other duties and waited upon her
whims. And she, Tory though she was, delighted in
seeing the haughty bend the knee to a girl from the
Old Dominion.</p>
<p>And that graceful fellow, Andre, who had a knack
for rhyme, a little skill with the brush, and could design
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
a lady&#8217;s costume with even better success than he could
pen a verse, ah, he was in his seventh heaven! Time
enough to sorrow bye and bye when he should step
from a cart with a rope about his neck, all because of
Benedict Arnold.</p>
<p>There was a triumphal arch erected in honour of
Lord Howe, and another in honour of his brother, the
general. There were pavilions to build around the
arena in which gaily attired knights, mounted on
richly caparisoned steeds, were to contend, knights in
white and knights in black, and their reward the
favours to be bestowed by the fair damsels of the
&#8220;Blended Rose&#8221; or &#8220;The Burning Mountain.&#8221; And
there were men and women no doubt&ndash;&ndash;usually
there are&ndash;&ndash;who would have sold their immortal
souls rather than have missed an invitation to attend.</p>
<p>Never before had America witnessed such a brave
display, the parade of floats upon the river, the fireworks,
the tournaments, the dazzling costumes, the
sumptuous banquet and the brilliant ball to conclude it
all; and then that beautiful Italian name, &#8220;Mischianza,&#8221;
the title by which it should be known to future
generations.</p>
<p>The sun was winking at the closed curtains of Lisbeth&#8217;s
room the next morning as she stood before her
mirror for a farewell glance at her splendid attire,
and that towering head-dress flashing with jewels over
which the hair-dresser had worked long and marvellously.
The face was fresh, the beautiful eyes undimmed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
the eyes of a conqueror, flashing as she recalled
Lord Howe bending low over her fair hand with
unmistakable admiration in his face.</p>
<p>While she thus admired herself, the drums were
beating and the soldiers were marching out of the city
to capture Lafayette, who, it was thought, would make
a suitable decoration for the glory of the Howes.
Really they should take away with them something in
the way of glory other than memories of an idle winter
amid Philadelphia&#8217;s hospitality, and of the pomp
and beauty of the &#8220;Mischianza.&#8221; But the poor soldiers
came marching back without their prize, while
the ladies were yet talking of the f&ecirc;te, their costumes
and their conquests. Yet, as we have learned, the
soldiers, missing their prize, did bring back a meagre
harvest for the maw of the Provost Prison, and of
that Rodney Allison was a part.</p>
<p>What of the poor fellow we left moaning in delirium,
and Lawrence Enderwood, doing his best to quiet
his friend, while he inwardly raged at their jailer&#8217;s
brutality? He was a very sick lad, as Lawrence could
see by the morning light filtering through the dirt of
the windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not last long in this den; they die like flies.
I know, for I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em,&#8221; said a haggard prisoner,
who had entered the prison a hale, lusty man and was
now a tottering skeleton.</p>
<p>Helpless to aid his friend, and forced to sit idly by
and see him suffer and die, Lawrence Enderwood
buried his face in his hands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&#8220;General Howe well might know this be no place
for women.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gruff, surly tone of Cunningham was answered
by one as sweet as the note of a song bird.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Captain, he surely might know it would be a
better place for human beings if it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawrence lifted his head and his eyes lighted, as
well they might, for the girl was a refreshing picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Miss Danesford. General Howe
not only might, he ought to know about this villainous
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Enderwood&ndash;&ndash;pardon, that epaulette declares
you are a captain and the red facings of your
blue coat indicate that you lead Virginians. Possibly,
however, the Mister to you is of more value than the
title of captain, since your General Washington has
made himself famous with the British as a plain
&#8216;Mister.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be very humiliating to their generals to be
beaten by a plain &#8216;Mister,&#8217; must it not? But I would
not say unpleasant things, for verily your visit is most
welcome, whether you came to see me or another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, most assuredly. Colonel Brent was boasting
yesterday of having bagged a genuine militia captain
from old Virginia, and, when he told me your name,
I did not thank him for his exploit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, I greatly appreciate your kindness.
Perhaps, having been so kind to a poor Virginia captain,
you may come to speak of &#8216;our&#8217; Washington,
for you are a daughter of Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>Lisbeth appeared not to notice this allusion to her
Tory principles, and exclaimed, as she looked with evident
disgust at the squalid surroundings: &#8220;Why will
men be so cruel to men? I will tell General Howe
some truths that will cause his ears to burn, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And shut the door against your return. You see
I am selfish enough to look for another visit, though
this pestilent hole is no place for you to visit. Howe
will do nothing. When he was in command at New
York our men literally rotted in the foul prison hulks
lying in the harbour. It is a cheap and an easy way
for killing us off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, no lectures, Captain Enderwood. Howe
shall know of this, and I believe will do something to
improve it. Meanwhile, here is a little basket of food
cooked by our old Nancy. You always praised
Nancy&#8217;s cooking when you came to &#8216;The Hall&#8217; in the
old days, so you are under obligations to eat every
crumb of it, even if it isn&#8217;t as good as the prison fare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good as the prison fare! Why, the cockroaches
that crawl around here are literally starving. It&#8217;s a
marvel you got past old Cunningham with this basket.
Nothing infuriates him so, and this morning I saw
him knock on the floor a bowl of broth brought to one
of the prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I can&#8217;t understand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and you never will until you get better acquainted
with men like Cunningham, which God forbid.
But tell me about the &#8216;Mis-er-&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mischianza?&#8217; Oh, it was the most delightful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
affair ever known. You should have seen it. The
floats on the river, the parades, the arches, the battles
between the knights and all! Well, Major Andre was
a true prophet when he said no Roman f&ecirc;te would
equal it. I simply can&#8217;t find words to describe ever
so little of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With you present I couldn&#8217;t have realized its magnificence
if I had seen it, was the thought in Enderwood&#8217;s
mind, but what he said was: &#8220;They tell me
it was gorgeous, and you may say with the old Roman,
er&ndash;&ndash;how do those Latin words go? Anyhow it was
to the effect that he&#8217;d been a part of the doings, quite
a big part at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Why, I was but a crumb at the banquet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, Lisbeth! Those flashing eyes, that colour such
as &#8220;blended rose&#8221; never had, that lithe, rounded figure
radiating vitality, bespeak too much of modesty in
your words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Nat, old boy, faster! We must save the
girl. Up and at &#8217;em, Rangers! Cheated of promotion,
and by a girl! Oh, Lisbeth, how could you do it!
You knew I&#8217;d believe what you told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s face is pale and her
voice trembles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another victim. I was about to ask you, if possible,
to have a doctor sent here. Cunningham refused
it. You know him, surely you do. It&#8217;s poor
Rodney Allison. He&#8217;ll not ride many more races,
I&#8217;m thinking, such as the night he rode and overtook
your horse and stopped it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Rodney! Don&#8217;t you know me, your old playmate?
Don&#8217;t you know Lisbeth? How hot his head is!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sat, as one dazed, with her cool hand on the
lad&#8217;s forehead. He lay more quietly under her kindly
touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t got to suffer as long as the most of us.
It will only be a question of a few days in this place,&#8221;
said Lawrence, bitterly.</p>
<p>Lisbeth looked up, and Lawrence saw that her eyes
glittered and her face looked hard. She bade him
adieu and was gone before he could say more.</p>
<p>&#8220;She come in like an angel o&#8217; mercy an&#8217; went out
with a face like Jezebel&#8217;s. Guess she was feared she
mought ketch the fever,&#8221; said one of the prisoners.
Captain Enderwood swore at the poor old man, though
the captain ever respected age and regarded profanity
as the mark of a boor.</p>
<p>That night Rodney Allison slept in a clean bed in
a neat room, with a doctor by his side and a nurse
none other than Miss Danesford herself, while Captain
Lawrence Enderwood, on parole, walked about
the city and then took night watch at the side of his
sick friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>NEW VENTURES WITH OLD ACQUAINTANCES</h3>
</div>
<p>What is more grateful to a weak, weary
mortal on a hot morning than a snug seat
under the shade of a tree, stirred by a gentle
breeze from the river? Rodney Allison could think
of nothing, and sank into the seat with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>This was his first attempt at walking abroad since
his illness, during which the British had left Philadelphia
and returned to New York, pursued and harassed
by the Americans. That morning Captain
Enderwood had left him, and, when he had inquired
for his bill, he was told that it had been paid. He had
been dimly conscious during his illness of the presence
of a nurse other than Enderwood, but when he had
asked about it the captain had ignored the question and
talked about something else. Surely he was indebted
to some one for his life and life was very sweet this
July morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;When d&#8217;ye leave yer grave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Zeb! I was thinking about you, and wondering
if we&#8217;d ever meet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I was thinkin&#8217; the same thing when I got
sight o&#8217; you an&#8217; concluded we wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Concluded we wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye see, I &#8217;lowed &#8217;twas only yer ghost I was lookin&#8217;
at. Ye&#8217;ve either had poor victuals or a poor appetite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney had the first hearty laugh he enjoyed for
months and replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been pretty sick and am
lucky to have any sort of looks left. But what are you
doing in Philadelphia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hangin&#8217; around this town hopin&#8217; the schooner
Betsy has escaped the British and will bring my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the result o&#8217; my furlough in Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Melicite, of whom Donald Lovell told me so
much, consented. Zeb, you&#8217;re a born conqueror.
When you found you couldn&#8217;t capture Canada you won
a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More to my likin&#8217; than the whole o&#8217; Canada. Now
I&#8217;m wonderin&#8217; how I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to support her. A soldier&#8217;s
pay for a month won&#8217;t buy more&#8217;n a pinch o&#8217;
salt, an&#8217; salt ain&#8217;t very fillin&#8217; &#8217;thout somethin&#8217; to go
along with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know where we can get a square meal,
though it won&#8217;t taste as good as that roast pig down
in Jersey. Will you go with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain sure I&#8217;ll go. I reckon thar be no good o&#8217;
my hangin&#8217; round any longer to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they walked down Chestnut Street Rodney saw a
familiar figure approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeb, there comes one of the greatest men in the
country, Thomas Jefferson. Wonder if he&#8217;ll remember
me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>He was not left long in doubt. Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s face
was careworn and noticeably older than when Rodney
had last seen him, and the lad was but a shadow of his
former self, yet the man recognized him the moment
they met.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is my young friend this morning? You&#8217;ve
had an illness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just up from a fever. Mr. Jefferson, I want
you to know my friend, one of Morgan&#8217;s Rangers, Mr.
Campbell, or Zeb, as we call him. He&#8217;s been to me
almost as good a friend as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always glad to meet your friends, Rodney.
What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting till I get strength enough to go back
to Charlottesville. I was taken prisoner and am on
parole and I think home is the best place for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlottesville is a good place at all times, especially
now that Burgoyne&#8217;s troops are imprisoned
there. I should think you might also find it profitable
to return, for the prisoners kept there have put money
in circulation and made work. By the way, I haven&#8217;t
seen you since you sold your horse to my overseer. I
felt badly about that because I knew you didn&#8217;t let
him go without a sacrifice. I will give you a letter and
when you get back you take it to Monticello and get
the colt. You can pay me at your convenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was unexpected good fortune, and Rodney felt
very grateful. &#8220;I wish I had Nat here. I would start
to-morrow,&#8221; he remarked to Zeb as they walked
on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thar seems to be no such thing as complete satisfaction
in this world. Now, if I had a home fer
Melicite an&#8217; me to go to, well, I reckon I&#8217;d be a little
easier in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to Charlottesville with me. You heard what
Mr. Jefferson said about business being brisk there.
It&#8217;s only a little village, but we&#8217;ll find some way to
turn a dollar. You&#8217;ve got to come, unless you can find
something better.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it happened that Rodney and his friend and
Melicite, who arrived in due time, all found their way
to Charlottesville, and also found home and opportunity.</p>
<p>Rodney was surprised on his first visit to the quarters
of the &#8220;Convention troops,&#8221; as they were called.
On Colonel Harvey&#8217;s estate, about five miles distant
from the Court House at Charlottesville, barracks and
camps had been erected for the prisoners, who were
constructing a building to be used as a theatre. Many
of them had vegetable gardens, one officer, it was said,
having spent nearly five hundred dollars for seed to be
planted by his men.</p>
<p>When these prisoners had arrived there the previous
winter, after a march of over seven hundred miles
from Massachusetts, the hillside, which now bloomed,
was desolate and bleak. But few buildings had been
erected, and about the only provisions obtainable were
corn meal and water. All that had been changed as
by magic, and many of the poor fellows had not known
such comfort since leaving their homes in England,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
while most of the Hessians were faring better than
they ever had done at home.</p>
<p>It will be recalled that Gates had weakly consented
to terms which allowed Burgoyne&#8217;s soldiers to be
transported to England on condition they should not
fight against America. He was so eager to secure a
surrender, that he evidently did not stop to consider
that these soldiers could be used in England to replace
those stationed there, who in turn could be sent to
America. Shrewder men were quick to see the mistake
and to take advantage of any circumstance to prevent
it. Such a circumstance was afforded by Burgoyne
himself, who, not liking the quarters assigned to him
in Massachusetts, had declared the terms of the surrender
had been broken. Moreover, when the Americans
were ready to let the troops go on their arrival
in Massachusetts, the British would not provide transportation,
and by the time they were ready the Americans
had various pretexts for not complying with the
terms of the surrender. The British declared their
opponents acted in bad faith. Undoubtedly many
Americans believed England would act in bad faith
if she could get the troops back.</p>
<p>Zeb&#8217;s attitude on this question was that of many
Americans. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to argue the matter,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I can if necessary; the argyments been&#8217;t all on
one side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeb would always be lame from his wound, in fact
this had forced him to leave the army. &#8220;The Rangers
aren&#8217;t what they were,&#8221; he told Rodney, &#8220;since Morgan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
was given another command. He was the king
pin. He had a way o&#8217; seein&#8217; the Rangers got what
belonged to &#8217;em. They knew it, an&#8217; thar was nothin&#8217;
they wouldn&#8217;t do for him. I mind one day he was
ridin&#8217; past whar some o&#8217; the men were at work clearin&#8217;
a road. Two of &#8217;em were tryin&#8217; to roll out a big rock
an&#8217; a little squirt of a sergeant was bossin&#8217;. &#8216;Why
don&#8217;t ye help the men?&#8217; Morgan shouted at him. &#8216;I&#8217;m
an officer, sir,&#8217; says the sergeant. &#8216;Oh yes,&#8217; says Morgan.
&#8216;I didn&#8217;t think o&#8217; that,&#8217; an&#8217; he jumped off his
horse an&#8217; helped the men roll out the rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney&#8217;s work that fall often required him to visit
the prisoners&#8217; encampment. One day, as he was passing
a cabin, he heard some one call in a faint voice for
help. He rushed in and found a man lying on the
floor. He helped the man to his bed and as he did so
saw that he was none other than his old acquaintance,
the &#8220;Chevalier.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Allison did not feel so bitter against this
man as formerly, for the reason that his recent
experiences had brought him knowledge of bigger
rascals than he had ever supposed this man to be, yet
his feelings were far from being friendly. He nevertheless
ran for the camp doctor and waited until he
had declared the man out of danger for the present.
Rodney heard his advice to the patient, that he keep
very quiet and free from excitement, as otherwise his
next attack might prove fatal.</p>
<p>Rodney turned back into the cabin to ask if there
were anything he might do, and the look in the face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
of the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; startled the lad. It quickly passed,
however, and the man quietly said: &#8220;Why, this is
Rodney Allison, who saved my miserable existence out
on the Scioto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of an exploit to be remembered by.
You&#8217;d have shot him if I hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you shot the redskin in the heel and, if I
correctly recall my mythology, Paris required the
assistance of the god, Apollo, before he was able to
hit Achilles in a like spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He only had a bow and arrow while I had one of
the finest rifles in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, it was an act worthy of a better return,
as you no doubt concluded later.&#8221;</p>
<p>This allusion to the gaming incident annoyed Rodney.
He thought the least the fellow might do was to
make no mention of that rascally affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t refer to that matter I see no reason for
you to do so. Of late I&#8217;ve been associated with men
who think that, after you&#8217;ve rolled a man in the dirt,
it isn&#8217;t necessary to rub it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; whistled and then smilingly
quoted:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent5'>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;&#8216;The duke, he drew out half his sword&ndash;&ndash;<br />
<span class='indent7'>&nbsp;</span>The guard drew out the rest.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Can I do any more for you, sir?&#8221; Rodney spoke
impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might tell me how are the mother and the
little sister and about the home you feared the miser
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
would get. You see I have a good memory for some
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are well. They yet have the home, though I
did my best to sacrifice it. If there&#8217;s nothing I may
do I will be going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are kind, and I wish you would call again.
I expected you would be in the army. As I remember,
you were a lusty young rebel when I knew
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I served with Colonel Morgan&#8217;s Rangers at the
capture of Burgoyne.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be admitted there was a touch of malice
in these words and the tone in which the lad spoke
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m still further indebted to you. Well, as you
are responsible for my being here, I hope you will feel
under obligations to call again when I am better able
to entertain company. By the way, did you ever know
a man by the name of David Cameron? Why I ask is
because you resemble a man by that name, whom I
once knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my father&#8217;s name,&#8221; replied Rodney, and
the next instant he could have bitten his tongue. He
quickly added: &#8220;My father, after coming to this country,
had good reasons for taking the name of his
mother&#8217;s people, the Allisons, not that he had any
occasion to be ashamed of the name of Cameron.
Now that he is dead we shall retain the name of
Allison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I remember your father, he had no occasion to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
be ashamed of anything, except, possibly, some of his
acquaintances. So David is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father was a man who kept good company to
the day of his death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a very kind-hearted man, and such cannot
always keep what you term &#8216;good company.&#8217; May I
ask you to send here some worthy lawyer or trustworthy
justice of the peace? I have some transactions
which I wish to discuss with such a person. You,
being the son of your father, I know will do that
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where and when did you know my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than twenty years ago in London. When
did he die, Rodney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was killed at the battle of Point Pleasant at
the time we were out in the Ohio country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four years ago. Do you come often to the
camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frequently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it be asking too much for you to look in on
me, as they say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do as you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Rodney rode away he thought much upon the
strange man he had left. Evidently he was one whom
his father had befriended. And the rascal had tried to
rob his benefactor&#8217;s son. Probably, what with the
illness and all, the fellow&#8217;s conscience twinged a little.
Anyhow, he should have the lawyer though it were
better he should have the clergyman, thought the
lad.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>That night Rodney found it difficult to put thoughts
of the sick man out of his mind and, when a few days
later he again had occasion to visit the camp, he took
along with him some delicacies which he thought
might tempt the patient&#8217;s appetite.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t forget me. What&#8217;s this? Something
besides camp fare? Oh, yes, you are David
Cameron&#8217;s son, but you&#8217;ve got a life work ahead if
you live up to his standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you be willing to send this letter? I
suppose it will reach Philadelphia in a few days. By
the way, did your father come to Charlottesville from
London?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He lived nearly eighteen years down in
Prince William County. He was employed there much
of the time by Squire Danesford.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danesford! Did he have a daughter about your
own age?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Lisbeth. She was in Philadelphia the last I
knew of her. I heard the other day that the state had
seized their estate. Danesford is a bitter Tory, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danesford died a poor man in London last April.
His daughter, I understand, died about three months
later. At least the person to whom that letter is
addressed wrote me she couldn&#8217;t live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are&ndash;&ndash;are you sure? I didn&#8217;t even know she
was sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked keenly at his caller. &#8220;I have no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
reason to doubt the report. It was said she took her
father&#8217;s death very much to heart, and, what with not
being well,&ndash;&ndash;she had nursed a friend, I think,&ndash;&ndash;she
was taken down with a fever. You must have known
her?</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, she was my playmate. I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t realize
she&#8217;s dead.&#8221; Then hurriedly saying good-bye
he went away, seeing little and thinking much,
and the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; lay looking at the blank
wall.</p>
<p>On arriving home Rodney went directly to his
room. He shrank from telling the news to his mother.
He must first think it over. The girl in the red cloak
who had stamped her foot and called him a simpleton,
ah, she was the one he missed, and not her who had
laughed in his face that winter night and wheedled
him as she laughed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Allison was greatly shocked. Rodney had
been ashamed to tell his mother of the time Lisbeth
had tricked him, and now it somehow seemed disloyal
to the girl to speak of it. Well, he would forget it,
and so resolving he worked as never before. There
was work to do, both for himself and Zeb; moreover,
it was profitable.</p>
<p>When he next had occasion to visit the encampment
he called on the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; as soon as he arrived.
All the way to the camp the question had been in his
mind: How did it happen that the man knew the
Danesfords, spoke of them as persons with whom he
was quite familiar? He met Angus, who said, &#8220;Ridin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
back along soon?&#8221; and, on being told, replied, &#8220;I
reckon I&#8217;ll wait fer ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney found the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; unusually bright
and nimble of wit. &#8220;I suppose, Allison, you think the
war is over with the surrender of Burgoyne? Most of
your people lose no opportunity to express that opinion.
I notice, however, that the British army marches about
the country pretty much as it pleases. Why, my lad,
the war is just begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly it&#8217;s a good beginning,&#8221; was the lad&#8217;s
rather dry response.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chevalier&#8221; appreciated it. There was a
twinkle in his eyes. It was evident he liked to draw
Rodney out. He said: &#8220;What would you people do
if by some accident, for you can never hope to win
unless some other powerful nation helps you, what
would you do if you should win? All the colonies
would be by the ears in less than a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you never heard what &#8216;Sam&#8217; Adams
told the Quakers who said they wished to obey such
government as the Lord placed over them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told them the Lord was providing a government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think this so-called government, where
Congress may only humbly ask the several colonies,
each to do its part, a pretty poor sort of government to
lay at the Lord&#8217;s door? Why, once these colonies
get clear of England, they&#8217;ll fight among themselves.
But, even if they didn&#8217;t, the country would have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
patchwork of little petty governments and nothing in
common to make them strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember what Gadsden said at New
York at the meeting held in protest against the Stamp
Act?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; what was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;There ought to be no New England
man, no New Yorker known on the continent; but all
of us, Americans.&#8217; I well remember father speaking
of that. There was a queer codger who joined the
Rangers. The men, because of his long legs, named
him &#8216;Lopin&#8217; Luther,&#8217; and he once said: &#8216;We&#8217;re fightin&#8217;
fer free Englishmen as well as Americans, only the
darn fools don&#8217;t know it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, or rather he meant, the principle
involved. But, from what I have learned, the more of
what the people term freedom they have, the more
they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not? Whoever called you the &#8216;Cavalier,&#8217;
evidently knew why he did so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face became grave. He said: &#8220;I am not
worthy of the name. I have great respect for those
who were known as Cavaliers. Some of your best
blood in the Old Dominion descended from them. I
believe it isn&#8217;t so much what people have as the way
they use it. I&#8217;ve seen those who were getting along
finely until something more was added to them, then
make a failure of it. Take your hero, Morgan; what
did he have but his own courage and brains and powerful
body? He&#8217;s made the most of what he had.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Had he been born a duke he might not have done so
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could he have done what he has in your country,
where your dukes are born with the privilege of
lording it over the Morgans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rodney, you argue well. Where did you learn?
I forget your father. You are indeed his son. Must
you go? Well, here is a packet, of which I wish you
to take charge. When you learn that I am dead, and
the doctor tells me my heart is about worn out, you
are to open the packet and I am sure will do right
with what you find there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney hesitated, and the man, noticing his hesitation,
said, &#8220;You will not regret it. You believe me,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking into the face of the man, Rodney had it
not in his heart to say no. Somehow, and he was
almost ashamed to admit it to himself, he did believe.
This man, who, under the guise of friendliness, once
had robbed him, this gambler, literally compelled his
liking.</p>
<p>When Allison had finished the business for which
he had come, and was about to leave, he noticed the
camp doctor hurrying to the Chevalier&#8217;s cabin. With
fear in his heart he followed. The fear was realized.
The man who had been known to him as the &#8220;Chevalier&#8221;
was dead. Rodney helped prepare the body.
He had performed similar services for friends who
had died in camp. It was not a duty from which he
would flinch. Yet he started back, his face was pale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
The doctor noticed the agitation and sought the cause.
Young Allison was staring at tattoo marks on the
right arm of the body. These represented a closed
hand gripping a sword. Rodney had seen the exact
counterpart of that on the right arm of little Louis,
who had told him, &#8220;Papa put it there!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>WHAT THE PACKAGE CONTAINED</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble here, Rodney?&#8221; asked
Angus, shouldering his way in through a
throng of the curious, assembled about
the door of the cabin.</p>
<p>The hearty voice of his friend helped Rodney to
collect himself. &#8220;There has been a sudden death; he
was a man I knew,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve lost a good friend,&#8221; said Angus,
when he saw the face of the figure on the couch. &#8220;He
certain sure did you a good turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney&#8217;s look showed that he wondered just what
his friend meant. He was not aware that Angus knew
the man.</p>
<p>Seeing that Rodney seemed puzzled, Angus said:
&#8220;Why, that time he euchred old Denham. You told
me then ye didn&#8217;t know him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? This the man who paid off
the mortgage? Oh! if I had known that!&#8221;</p>
<p>It all came to Rodney Allison, as light comes to one
who has been blind, and is made to see. This man,
instead of a knave, had been his friend! He had won
the money in gambling that it might be used for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
right purpose. He had so used it, and taken from his
own purse as well. The sense of having done an
injustice is very bitter when the injured has passed
beyond one&#8217;s power to atone!</p>
<p>When everything had been done that might be, and
Allison and McGregor were walking away, the latter
said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve found a feller as is lookin&#8217; fer a good
horse. He saw Nat when you rode in this mornin&#8217; an&#8217;
he asked no end o&#8217; questions, whar ye lived, how ter git
thar an&#8217; said he was thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; buyin&#8217;. I &#8217;lowed as
how &#8217;twould take a tote o&#8217; money ter buy. Thar goes
the identical minion o&#8217; King George, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney looked in the direction indicated. &#8220;That
knave!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;d never sell Nat to him if I
needed the money to buy bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t like his looks, eh? Yer powerful fussy.
He ain&#8217;t the best lookin&#8217; feller I ever did see, but I
reckon his money&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other made no reply. He could not explain his
antipathy to Mogridge, for it was he whom Angus had
pointed out. So he&#8217;s here, thought Rodney, wondering
what he could want with a horse.</p>
<p>Allison was not an unduly inquisitive youth, but it
may readily be imagined his pulse quickened when he
sat down with his mother to open the package which
had been given him by the &#8220;Chevalier.&#8221; It almost
seemed that the man had known he was about to die,
though his manner had been so cheerful.</p>
<p>Ah! Here was money&ndash;&ndash;the package had seemed
heavy&ndash;&ndash;nearly fifty pounds in all; and here was his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
gold watch and seal ring and a letter. He quickly
opened the letter and read with wonderment in his
eyes, and then tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>My Dear Rodney</span>:&ndash;&ndash;The man, whose life your
father once saved at risk of his own, and whom
you again saved from the bullet of a savage, wishes to
express his sense of obligations. Please accept the
contents of this packet as such an expression, for the
obligations themselves cannot be repaid; also what I
have tried to provide in the will which you will find
enclosed. I would suggest that you consult the lawyer
whom you brought to me at my request. Rightly
cared for, the inheritance will ensure your mother and
sister against want and afford you the chance of which
you have been deprived on account of lack of funds.
I&#8217;m sure you will understand that I do not allude to
&#8216;Chance,&#8217; the fickle goddess of the gaming table, and
I have been happy to learn you profited by the lesson
I taught you. Had I learned a similar one at your
age, that one may not obtain something for nothing
and be happy in the possession, I might have been of
some service in the world. Instead, my life has been a
failure, and that which I am leaving to you was the
fruit of the service of my forebears. May you never
feel the humiliation of uselessness, of having contributed
nothing to the world that was of value!</p>
<p>&#8220;The property is in England, and not until the war
shall be ended, I presume, will it be possible for you to
come into the inheritance. I am leaving no near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
kindred. My little son died in Canada during my
absence; his name was Louis. Elizabeth Danesford&#8217;s
mother I knew when she was a girl and lived in London,
and, for her sake, her daughter, had she lived,
was to have had the half of what I&#8217;m leaving to you.
The estate in England, which Louis would have inherited,
reverts to a distant cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know whether your father ever told of his
acquaintance with me, nor what his feelings toward
me may have been. Surely, there was ample cause why
they should have been unpleasant, but I like to think
they were kindly. He loved me despite the sore distress
I so often caused him, but when I struck him
down, thinking him an enemy, and fled, believing
myself a murderer, he must ever after have thought I
deserted him. I hope he knows better now.</p>
<p>&#8220;After that horrible experience I joined the army
in Canada and a year later was married. Louis was
born and, after six years of such happiness as one who
believes himself a criminal may enjoy, my wife died
and Louis went to live with her parents near Lachine.
One day I met a man who recognized me and, fearing
exposure, I fled to New York, later to Philadelphia and
then to Virginia at the outbreak of Dunmore&#8217;s war.
After that I returned to Canada only to learn that
Louis had died. It seemed as if a fatality pursued all
I loved. I went to England, determined to give myself
up to justice, but was astounded to learn that there
was no evidence that a crime had been committed. I
was told your father did not die but was put aboard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
ship for the Colonies. Believing that England, however
much in fault as to administration, was right in
fighting to retain her government over this country, I
again entered the army. The day on which I had the
serious attack of heart trouble, and called for assistance
and you came, I saw that in your face which told me
you must be near of kin to David Cameron. I wonder
that I never had noted the resemblance. If you are
like him, as I believe, you will not leave the world the
poorer for having lived in it, and at the end will not,
as I, feel impelled to recall these lines which that
wretch Wharton wrote:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;&#8216;Be kind to my remains, and oh! defend,<br />
Against your judgment, your departed friend.&#8217;<br />
</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Richard W. Ralston</span>.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Dick Ralston! And but for him I would not have
had David. The ways of Providence are past finding
out, Rodney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor would we have had a home but for him,
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, I forgot that. He had a kind heart and I
remember what an attractive gentleman I thought him,
the day he came here. Think what he might have
been!&#8221;</p>
<p>The day on which the remains of Ralston were laid
at rest, Rodney, on returning home, found Mam in a
state of agitation. She beckoned him into the house
and hoarsely whispered: &#8220;Dar&#8217;s a dirty Injun in de
shed. I wouldn&#8217; &#8217;low him ter set foot in dis yar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
house, I wouldn&#8217;, not ef he&#8217;d scalped me on de spot.
He grunt, an&#8217; squat, an&#8217; &#8217;lowed he done wouldn&#8217; stir
less he seed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I know him,&#8221; saying which, Rodney ran
out and, as he suspected, found Conrad stolidly waiting
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s little Louis, Conrad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He vould stay mit der priest at Detroit. He say
he a medicine man be himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Rodney wrote the letter Conrad was to take back
through the hundreds of miles of forest to the son of
Richard Ralston, he thought what a pity the boy&#8217;s
father died without seeing him. The son should know,
however, that he was loved and that his father had
been a brave man and that, if he but chose to return
to England, he might come into his inheritance. What
would he choose, the life of the missionary with all its
dangers and sacrifices, or that of a country gentleman,&ndash;&ndash;rather
what would his advisers choose for him?</p>
<p>Weeks lengthened into months and months into
years, slowly so far as concerned the progress of the
war, but swiftly with regard to the growth of the
country. Notwithstanding Continental money was
becoming almost worthless, bountiful crops were
raised and the greater part of the population were
engaged in work.</p>
<p>The surrender of Burgoyne had proved the success
necessary to enable that wise old man, Benjamin
Franklin, to secure recognition of the United States
by France. A French fleet hovered along the coast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
and annoyed the British without accomplishing anything
decisive. The American people seemed less
inclined to make great effort, relying on French aid
to secure independence for them. Corruption,&ndash;&ndash;depriving
the army of supplies and money,&ndash;&ndash;the
weakness of Congress,&ndash;&ndash;unable to do more than suggest
and leave to the several states to respond or not
as they chose,&ndash;&ndash;all served to delay the war. But for
Washington, patient and wise, standing as a tower of
strength about which the patriotic people might rally,
the end of it all might well have been in doubt. The
people of the country, however, did not doubt. The
great majority of them believed their cause invincible.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s army had chased Clinton&#8217;s British
troops from Philadelphia back to New York, and
would have inflicted serious punishment upon them but
for the treachery of General Charles Lee. As it was,
Washington saw the hand of Providence in the fact
that, after two years, his and the British army were
back in their old positions with the British less confident
and powerful. General Howe on returning to
England had remarked: &#8220;Things go ill and will not
go better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wyoming massacre, perpetrated by Indians and
Tories, sent a thrill of horror over the land, and the
man who had been thinking the war would be ended
without further assistance from him burned to fight
the foe. The successes of Clark in capturing British
posts west of the Alleghanies, and so laying the foundation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
of our claim to that vast territory, increased
Rodney&#8217;s restlessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeb,&#8221; he said to his friend on hearing the report,
&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to long to go West again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to know what is thought of a man as
fools with fire after havin&#8217; his fingers burned once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it. I know that is a wonderful country.
Great work will be done there in the next few
years and I want a share in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;d wait till the war is over an&#8217; the redskins
are tamed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to. But it&#8217;ll be either the
West or the war for me before long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeb looked shrewdly at his friend, wondering why
he was so restless, for he had prospered. &#8220;It&#8217;s nigh
two years since we licked Burgoyne an&#8217; they don&#8217;t
make much headway. Reckon we&#8217;ll hev to go back an&#8217;
show &#8217;em how we used to do it. But, if we ain&#8217;t
needed, it will be too bad to leave things here just as
we&#8217;ve got &#8217;em into shape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought never to go to the front again, Zeb.
You&#8217;ve done your share and, with your wound and
your rheumatism, you couldn&#8217;t last long in camp.
You stay at home and take charge of matters and let
me go. I heard yesterday that the British are having
things their own way down in South Carolina, murdering
and pillaging. Cornwallis evidently intends to
frighten the people into submission and then invade
Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t licked &#8217;em to a standstill yet awhile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
Thar&#8217;s Sumter an&#8217; Marion left, an&#8217; the boys o&#8217; the
mountains,&ndash;&ndash;oh! but he&#8217;ll have trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear the Tories down there are helping the
British much more than the Tories in any other part of
the country have been able to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless they do they won&#8217;t help much. They were
goin&#8217; ter help Burgoyne an&#8217; didn&#8217;t amount to a pinch
o&#8217; snuff. All they can do in the way o&#8217; fightin&#8217; is
killing women an&#8217; children an&#8217; then scalpin&#8217; &#8217;em.
Anyhow, if ye can&#8217;t keep contented at home any
longer I&#8217;ll try to look after matters here while you are
away. But why not get advice from your friend at
Monticello? &#8217;Pears to me you have done your share
of the fightin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to bother him with my petty affairs,
with his many important duties. Being governor of
Virginia is enough for one man, let alone all he&#8217;s
doing for national affairs and for education. I
wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he did something to abolish
slavery; father believed he would. You know Mr.
Jefferson says he trembles for the future when he
thinks that God is just.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll never live to see it, Rodney.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney inherited his father&#8217;s hatred of slavery, and
his kindly feelings toward all men, but the following
morning, when he went to the stable and found that
Nat, together with saddle and bridle, had been stolen
in the night, and thought of what Mogridge had asked
Angus&ndash;&ndash;well, it was fortunate for both that young
Allison and Mogridge did not meet that morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>RODNEY RIDES WITH THE DRAGOONS</h3>
</div>
<p>After the battle of Camden, in which Gates
was sorely defeated by Cornwallis, affairs in
the South looked very dubious for the American
forces. A large part of the people in South
Carolina and Georgia were loyalists, and their relations
with their Whig neighbours were exceedingly
bitter. Except for small bands of patriots under
daring leaders like Marion and Sumter, &#8220;The Carolina
Gamecock,&#8221; as his followers proudly called him,
the British and their Tory allies held possession of
Georgia and South Carolina and were planning
to sweep northward into North Carolina and on
into Virginia. Cornwallis&#8217; fame was in the ascendant.</p>
<p>Such were the conditions on that October day when
Rodney Allison joined the army of Gates. Two days
later came the cheering news that a force of Tories
under the command of Colonel Ferguson had been
almost annihilated at King&#8217;s Mountain by a body of
pioneer Whigs, most of whom came from the border
settlements over the mountains. A number of those
captured, known to be guilty of murder, were hanged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
and the impression made on other Tories in those
states was very depressing.</p>
<p>The Americans now expected great assistance from
the militia of those states, but the British emissaries
among the Indians incited them to attack the frontier
settlements, thus making it necessary for those brave
fellows who had won the battle of King&#8217;s Mountain to
return home to protect their families from the savages.</p>
<p>When finally General Nathaniel Greene, at Washington&#8217;s
request, was sent to supersede Gates, he found
an army of only about two thousand men, poorly
equipped, the enemy strongly entrenched, the country
swept bare of subsistence and winter approaching.</p>
<p>Through the influence of General Morgan, Rodney
was assigned to duty with Colonel Washington&#8217;s
dragoons. It was a proud moment for the lad when
he found himself associated with the finest body of
cavalry in the army. Those daring horsemen were the
terror of the Tories and young Allison rode with them
on many a daring exploit, a full account of which
would fill a volume. The lad had now grown to man&#8217;s
stature and sat his horse like a veteran. How often
on those wild rides he longed to be on the back of Nat
once more! Poor fellow, what had become of him?
The sight of the spur-scarred, hard-ridden horses of
the British cavalry filled him with fury as he thought
it probable the fate of his beloved colt had been like
theirs.</p>
<p>Finally came the day when General Morgan was to
add another to the long list of his successes. Cornwallis
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
and Colonel Tarleton, &#8220;the bloodhound,&#8221; had
planned to trap Morgan and annihilate his force. The
latter was compelled to retreat and Tarleton was sent
in pursuit. When he believed Morgan was fleeing
from him he threw caution to the winds and hurried
his force on to what he doubted not would be the
capture of the doughty leader.</p>
<p>Morgan has since been criticized for hazarding a
battle. His force was far inferior to Tarleton&#8217;s and
did not include artillery as did the latter&#8217;s. Moreover,
with Morgan were many raw militia who could not be
depended upon to face the veterans under the British
leader, knowing, as they did from sad experience, that
little quarter would be granted them if defeated. But
he had the veteran Marylanders who had fought so
bravely at Camden, and the support of Colonel Washington&#8217;s
dragoons. Furthermore, shrewd leader of
men that he was, he felt that the moment had come
when he must fight. To continue his flight meant capture
or dispersion of his forces. He believed that
Tarleton would be over-confident and so run headlong
into whatever trap he might set, and this was just
what happened.</p>
<p>At a place called the Cowpens he found the position
he desired. Here were two small hills, one behind the
other and with a river at the rear; no place for a scared
militiaman to escape, nothing to do but fight to his last
gasp, because he knew that if he offered to surrender
he would be ruthlessly bayoneted.</p>
<p>The night before the battle it is said Morgan did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
sleep. His men, enraged at the cruelties inflicted
upon their country by the invaders, were longing for
revenge. This spirit Morgan fanned to flame.
Throughout the night this big, brawny man, whose
fame for success in many perilous undertakings inspired
the confidence of every man who came to know
him, walked among the soldiers and talked with them.
His was the appearance of a man perfectly confident
that the next day would bring victory and glory to
American arms. He laughed and joked with them.
&#8220;Just hold up your heads, boys; give &#8217;em three fires
and you are free. The Old Wagoner will crack his
whip over Ben Tarleton in the morning, sure as he
lives. Think of what your wives an&#8217; sweethearts will
say when you go home an&#8217; tell what ye did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah! How they loved and admired the big fellow
who was one of them. He had stormed the defences
at Quebec after leading his men through an almost
impassable wilderness; he had led his Rangers in wild
charges against the regulars under Burgoyne and
driven them; he would win, and they would help him,
to the last drop of blood in their veins.</p>
<p>In that spirit of implicit confidence in their stalwart
leader even the raw recruits never thought of trembling
on that raw morning in the middle of January,
1781, when the outposts came riding back with the
report that Tarleton was approaching. They had been
placed down in front with the Marylanders at their
backs to support them, and Colonel Washington&#8217;s
dragoons screened behind the hill waiting for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
word to charge. In front of the Carolina and Georgia
militia, between whom Morgan had excited a spirit of
rivalry as to which body should behave with the
greater bravery under fire, riflemen had been stationed.</p>
<p>Soon the American sharpshooters in front began
firing and falling back toward the militia, who never
wavered. They had been ordered to hold their fire
and they obeyed implicitly.</p>
<p>Now the solid wall of British infantry is almost
upon them, and a sheet of flame spurts out along the
American line; then another and another, and those
raw soldiers only retreat before overwhelming numbers
when it is apparent they can resist no longer, and
then, like veterans, slowly and under orders.</p>
<p>Over behind the hill Rodney Allison&#8217;s knees grip
his horse. This waiting is worse than fighting, waiting
for that soul-stirring word, &#8220;Charge!&#8221; Now it rings
out and echoes through the ranks, and like a whirlwind
they sweep right through the lines of Tarleton&#8217;s
cavalry forming for a charge, and, wheeling about,
come riding and slashing back through them again.
Colonel Howard is skilfully handling the troops and
the gallant Pickens rallying the militia. The British
ranks waver and become disorganized, the Americans
charge and the British throw down their arms and sue
for mercy or flee from the field.</p>
<p>Tarleton is trying to rally his shattered horsemen
when down upon them come Washington&#8217;s dragoons,
with Colonel Washington far ahead of his men.</p>
<p>Then it is that Tarleton tries to kill or capture his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
antagonist. Washington&#8217;s sword is broken at the hilt
and, but for the assistance of a boy, the brave Washington
would have been struck down. Now his men
are at his back and Tarleton rides away with his
fleeing men as though pursued by demons.</p>
<p>Then come orders to pursue and the dragoons go
riding out into the country after the fleeing British.
Most of them choose a wrong road and only succeed
in picking up a few stragglers.</p>
<p>Rodney had charged and wheeled and charged
again. It had been his fortune to be in the thickest of
the struggle from first to last. Then he joined in the
pursuit.</p>
<p>The group of horsemen with whom Rodney was
riding came to forks in the road. Rodney&#8217;s training
among the Indians often proved valuable and now he
declared there were but two horses of the enemy on
the road they had come, also that they had divided at
the forks, each taking a different road. As many of
the cavalry had come to the Cowpens over this road
early the same morning, there was a confusion of
tracks and a consequent confusion in the minds of the
pursuers. Allison doggedly stuck to his conclusion
and rode on alone.</p>
<p>Judging from the tracks, it was evident that the
fleeing British cavalryman had ridden his horse at a
mad gallop and Rodney urged his own to the utmost.</p>
<p>On either side of the road stretched a scraggly
growth of trees. Suddenly his horse shied and at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
same instant a pistol shot rang out. The lad&#8217;s left
hand relaxed its grasp of the bridle and slipped nervelessly
to his side. The ball had broken his arm below
the elbow. Had his horse not been frightened and
shied, the ball intended for his heart probably would
have hit the mark.</p>
<p>A British rider came crashing through the bushes.
Finding there was but one pursuer, and he wounded,
the fellow had decided to fight. He certainly had
Allison at serious disadvantage, but the latter, slipping
the half drawn pistol back into the holster, grasped
the bridle with his uninjured hand and wheeled his
horse sharply to meet the foe, who was almost upon
him.</p>
<p>For an instant each stared in astonishment at the
other. Then into the face of young Allison swept a
savage fury. His gray eyes looked black and blazing.
He dropped the bridle and drew his sword, spurring
his unguided horse forward. The horse swerved and
Rodney missed the blow he aimed at the head of his
antagonist. The latter was a better swordsman on
equal terms, and Rodney, unable to use his left hand,
was at a decided disadvantage.</p>
<p>Soon he was at his wits&#8217; end. Twice the thrust of
his antagonist had grazed his neck. Thinking he had
Rodney at his mercy, the Englishman rose in his
stirrups and swung his blade with evident intent to
cut him down. In parrying the blow Rodney&#8217;s inferior
blade was broken near the hilt, which was knocked
from his hand. He struck his horse a smart blow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
with his right spur, reached for his pistol and cried
&#8220;Down, Nat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mogridge, for the Englishman was none other than
the one who had stolen Nat and nearly ridden him to
death, again rose in his stirrups, confident of cutting
down his foe. The look of malignant hate in his face
changed to that of consternation; the horse under
him was kneeling!</p>
<p>Rodney draws his pistol. The foe is wickedly spurring
and yanking the bridle and cursing his horse.
Every thrust of the spur into Nat&#8217;s gaunt flanks pricks
Rodney as well. He aims to kill and his finger is on
the trigger, when, like a flash of light, he recalls Zeb&#8217;s
words: &#8220;Killin&#8217; even an enemy is serious, an&#8217; not
pleasant to dream about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dismount and surrender your arms or I&#8217;ll blow
out your brains,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>Mogridge dared not disobey.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will now lead that horse back to camp. If he
could ride you he should have the chance, you cur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s such a thing as courtesy even in war,&#8221;
replied Mogridge, though he was careful to do as he
was bid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with horse thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s fair in love and war,&#8221; retorted Mogridge,
and then, seeing the look in Allison&#8217;s face, he wisely
decided to say no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>HOME AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Back at the scene of the battle Rodney found
preparations were being made for the little
army to march, leaving a detachment behind
to dispose of the dead and care for the wounded. No
one seemed to know where they were to go. Many
thought, in view of the fact that the British had been
defeated and Tarleton put to flight, Morgan would
remain in the vicinity for reinforcements and await an
attack by Cornwallis. Few realized what a daring
thing he had already done.</p>
<p>Had Tarleton&#8217;s headlong charges thrown his meagre
forces into confusion they would have had little opportunity
to retreat and most of them would have been
cut down. Morgan afterwards was criticized by the
envious for having risked a battle under the circumstances.
He believed he knew that it was necessary to
fight that battle and he had won against odds. The
&#8220;Old Wagoner&#8221; didn&#8217;t propose to wait while Cornwallis
should overtake him with a superior force and
recapture the prisoners and spoils and annihilate his
forces. Instead, though he concealed his plans, he
resolved upon making the quickest retreat possible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
To do this he marched toward a ford which was
nearer to Cornwallis than to him. It was a great risk
but he felt he must take it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve got a home, you better get to it, my
lad,&#8221; the kindly doctor had said while hastily bandaging
the lad&#8217;s wounded arm. &#8220;This may give ye
trouble, though I hope not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good advice,&#8221; said Morgan, who chanced
to overhear the doctor&#8217;s words and recognized Rodney.
&#8220;You report to Colonel Washington and tell
him Morgan has ordered you home to Charlottesville.
This war has eaten up too many of my Rangers already.&#8221;
With that parting advice he mounted his
horse and rode away.</p>
<p>There remained for Rodney nothing to do but obey
orders, though he was loath to leave. The spirit of
victory was in his soul. That had been a glorious
battle and the right had triumphed. The bloodhounds
had put their tails between their legs and fled. He did
not realize that they would rally and soon be close
upon the heels of the retreating Americans, and that
nothing would save the latter but the winter floods
which were to fill the rivers and delay the British.</p>
<p>Through a land ravaged by war, over roads deep
with mud, where might be found only the poorest
accommodations for man or beast, Rodney Allison
rode homeward. His arm give him little trouble
except the fear it might always be stiff. The nearer
he came to home the more he longed to be back with
the army. It troubled him to think that in the victories
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
he was sure would follow he could not have a
part.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never able to win promotion,&#8221; he said to
himself, rather bitterly. The picture of that winter
night, the witching face of Lisbeth and her mocking
laugh as she rode away, kept recurring to his mind.
What a girl she had been, the best playmate even a
boy might wish; always ready for a lark, daring,
mischievous, with wit as keen as a blade and quick as a
flash. He could not think of her as dead, and the
bitterness of his heart at the trick she had played upon
him troubled him now as he looked back upon it.
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t know what she was doing, did she, Nat,
old boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nat had been plodding along but now lifted his head
with some show of interest. The hard life he had led
since the day Mogridge had stolen him had not quite
broken his spirit, though he was gaunt and worn with
cruel service.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you, Nat, if I haven&#8217;t got a promotion,
and of the two I&#8217;d rather have you,&#8221; said his rider,
patting his shoulder.</p>
<p>The lad was nearing his long journey&#8217;s end. In the
distance were the mountains. A few miles further and
Monticello would be visible. Over those mountains lay
what seemed to the lad a great world. The life he had
lived in it seemed like another life and Ahneota, little
Louis, the Indian village and all, but the fancies of a
dream. Sometime he would go back there.</p>
<p>When he saw the familiar house a thought came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
his mind, and he wondered it had not come sooner.
Would he find them as he had left them, mother, and
&#8217;Omi, and Zeb, and Mam, and Thello?</p>
<p>For an instant he almost feared to go on. Ah, there
was Mam, waddling across from house to shed, probably
going to call Thello from his favourite seat in the
sunshine on the sheltered side of the building. The
door opens and his mother runs out. She has seen
him riding up, and she cries: &#8220;Rodney, my boy!&#8221; and
throws her arms about his neck, standing on tiptoe,
for he is tall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one arm left for hugging, Mother. This is
the only badge I bring back from the war,&#8221; and he
pointed to his arm in the sling, adding, as he
notes her alarm, &#8220;it&#8217;s nothing serious. How are you
all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All well and happy now you are back, all save poor
old Thello, who&#8217;s very miserable, but sight of you will
make him forget his aches, I&#8217;m sure. Why, Rodney,
where did you find Nat? Don&#8217;t you know me, Nat, or
have they treated you so badly you&#8217;ve forgotten old
friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>Naomi, now grown to a handsome girl, ran out and
it was some minutes before quiet was restored. Then
Rodney asked for Zeb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent him to Philadelphia. I learned a very dear
friend of ours living there is in sore trouble, and I
hope he will succeed in having her return with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any one I know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one you are much interested in. Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
friend, Captain Enderwood, who had been to Philadelphia
to see her, came all the way to Charlottesville
to tell us about her. He also told me how she was the
one who had you released from prison and nursed you
through your sickness while you were unconscious,
and made herself sick in consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&ndash;&ndash;you can&#8217;t mean&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that Elizabeth Danesford is alive. The
mistake came from the report that she couldn&#8217;t live.
Doesn&#8217;t it seem too good to be true?&#8221; and Mrs. Allison
watched Rodney&#8217;s face as she added: &#8220;She is very
poor. Captain Enderwood wished to marry her, he
frankly told me so, but you know it would require
more than poverty to weaken Lisbeth&#8217;s resolution.
The captain had heard her speak of me as her adopted
aunt and he came all the way to Charlottesville to tell
me about her. You see, her uncle and aunt in Philadelphia
are dead and she has no kin in this country
save a cousin who is not able to render her much if
any assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll not be poor if we ever get what the
&#8216;Chevalier&#8217; left to us in his will, for half of what he
gave to me, you know, he said he should have given
to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be difficult to persuade her to accept it.
Enderwood, you know, offered to share his fortune
with her and she refused.&#8221; There was a questioning
smile on Mrs. Allison&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Two days later Zeb returned from the Quaker City,
very much downcast in appearance until he saw Rodney,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
when his face lighted with pleasure that was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks how Tarleton let ye off easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was busy looking after himself. But, Zeb, it
seems you failed in your errand. Is Lis&ndash;&ndash;is Miss
Danesford sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I reckon,&#8221; and Zeb gave a shrewd glance at
Rodney, &#8220;the wrong man was sent. She looks pale
and tired. She has to work hard; she&#8217;s runnin&#8217; some
sort of a girls&#8217; school, an&#8217; I&#8217;d ruther train a yardful o&#8217;
raw recruits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you could not persuade her to come,&#8221;
was all Mrs. Allison said, but she looked at her son,
who remained silent.</p>
<p>About two weeks later he announced that he was
going to Philadelphia and no one questioned him as to
what his errand might be, though it was evident to
Zeb that Rodney&#8217;s mother was much pleased.</p>
<p>He had recovered from his wound, and good care
and plenty to eat had restored some of Nat&#8217;s good
spirits, so that man and horse made a very pleasing
appearance as they set forth on the long journey. Nat
found his rider impatient and both were tired when at
evening they reached the tavern where they were to
stop for the night. After supper Rodney sat on the
veranda watching the arrivals and departures, for the
house was a much frequented public resort on the main
thoroughfare.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>A REWARD GREATER THAN PROMOTION</h3>
</div>
<p>Rodney had risen from his seat to step inside
when the arrival of a coach, which bore the
marks of a long journey, attracted his attention.</p>
<p>The light from the small paned windows shone
dimly, but he saw that only two passengers alighted,
one a young woman accompanied by an old man who
appeared to be very feeble and leaned heavily on her.
&#8220;Father and daughter,&#8221; was Rodney&#8217;s thought, but
his words were, &#8220;May I assist,&#8221; as he went to meet
them.</p>
<p>The girl turned a white, tired face toward him, the
face of Elizabeth, but, oh! so unlike that which had
mocked him three years before!</p>
<p>&#8220;Rodney!&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, lass,&#8221; said the old man in a weak, quavering
voice. &#8220;Would the laddie were here the noo. I&#8217;m
a sair burden for your frail strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant Rodney&#8217;s face was whiter than Elizabeth&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! I am here,&#8221; he cried and took the tottering
man in his strong young arms.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>It was a strange story to which Rodney listened that
evening, one of thrilling interest and unusual even in
the annals of wild frontier life.</p>
<p>Not all Indians were grateful, especially when maddened
by lust for war and vengeance. In the gray
light of the dawn of the morning, after the fierce conflict
at Point Pleasant, the savage who, because of his
greed for scalps, had skulked behind when his fellows
had crossed the river the night before, bore little resemblance
in his war paint to the Indian David Allison
once had warmed and fed within the walls of the stockade
on a cold winter night; but he instantly recognized
his benefactor. For hours David Allison had lain unconscious
in the place where he had fallen. During
the night he had regained consciousness, but could
make no outcry louder than a moan. He had thought
to drag himself toward the camp where he might attract
the attention of his comrades, but had failed, and
lay back against a fallen tree, his face gray and ghastly.</p>
<p>The morning mists hung low over the river, and,
under cover of these, the savage paddled away unobserved,
his captive lying in a faint on the bottom of the
canoe. No prisoner ever received kinder treatment at
the hands of an Indian than did David Allison. As
he gradually regained his strength he yearned for home
and pleaded to be taken back to Virginia, but his captor
was obdurate; he wanted the man for a companion
and in many ways gave evidence of affection for him.</p>
<p>One day, in a quarrel with another savage, the Indian
was killed. Shortly after, Allison made his escape
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
and in a canoe drifted down the Ohio. He felt
unequal to attempting to work his way back as he had
come and so decided to go with the current down the
Ohio into the Mississippi. His utmost endurance and
shrewdness were put to many severe tests before he
reached a white settlement and eventually New
Orleans. There, when about to take ship for Norfolk,
he was taken sick with a fever which left him without
strength or money.</p>
<p>The desire to return home, whatever might be the
sacrifice, became almost a mania with him, but he
would not beg his way. And so he struggled on, meeting
with disappointment again and again, yet never
yielding in his purpose. Then, on the threshold of
success, when he landed in Philadelphia without money
and without friends, he was taken seriously ill. By
what seemed the merest chance Elizabeth learned of
him, and it was through her efforts and sacrifices that
he was spared, to enjoy in the comforts of home and
family, years, scant in number but abundant in happiness.</p>
<p>Rodney Allison won promotion&ndash;&ndash;the esteem of all
who knew him&ndash;&ndash;and who could wish for greater?
A few years later, on the spot where had stood the
lodge of Ahneota, he built a home such as he planned
that night, years before, when he lay by the spring
looking down on the sleeping Indian village; and Zeb
was his neighbour, prosperous and respected. Some
called Rodney &#8220;Colonel&#8221; Allison because of his military
experience and influence, but he preferred the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
title of &#8220;Squire,&#8221; and by this he was generally known
among neighbours and friends. In the Indian wars
he was serviceable in securing peace, for he was trusted
alike by red people and white. Through influential
friends, of whom General Morgan was one, he was
able to accomplish much that was of benefit to the
pioneers with whom he had cast his lot.</p>
<p>Soon after Benedict Arnold&#8217;s treason, Rodney received
a letter from Donald Lovell, then a captain in
the army. &#8220;Uncle Dick,&#8221; the letter said, &#8220;exclaimed
when he heard of it: &#8216;what a pity that a British bullet
had not taken his life before a British bribe killed his
good name!&#8217;&#8221; It became a custom for Rodney and
Zeb to yearly exchange letters with Donald Lovell
who, later in life, established his home down on the
far-away Kennebec River.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squire&#8221; Allison&#8217;s children were David, and Harriet,
and Elizabeth, and Rupert, and Donald; and
Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes were very dark blue with long lashes,
at times as serene as the eyes of the beautiful lady
whose portrait had greeted those who came to &#8220;The
Hall.&#8221; At other times they flashed, as did those which
her father, when a shivering soldier lad, saw looking
out of the old coach and mocking him as he stood
guard one bleak winter night.</p>
